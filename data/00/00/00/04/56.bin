梅瑞狄斯·奎尔
Meredith Quill.

316
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,370
我不敢相信我爱上了一个太空人
I can't believe I fell in love with a spaceman.

317
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,470
准备大展身手  混蛋们
Showtime, a-holes!

318
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,080
它随时会来
It will be here any minute.

319
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,730
那就是它倒霉了
Which will be its loss.

320
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,070
我以为你的武器是剑
I thought your thing was a sword?

321
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,060
我们受雇  阻止一个跨纬度怪物
We've been hired to stop an interdimensional beast

322
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,380
汲取这些电池的能量
from feeding on those batteries,

323
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,900
难道我还拿剑对付它
and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?

324
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,120
剑是你的武器  枪是我的专属嘛
It's just, swords were your thing and guns were mine.

325
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,160
但好吧  我们现在都用枪了
But I guess we're both doing guns now.

326
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,280
我之前不知道而已
I just didn't know that.

327
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,030
德拉克斯  你为什么没穿火箭的飞行装置
Drax, why aren't you wearing one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

328
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,270
穿上疼
It hurts.

329
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,490
穿上疼
It hurts?

330
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,660
我乳头很敏感
I have sensitive nipples.

331
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,480
"我乳头疼  我的天啊"
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"

332
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,320
那他呢  他在干什么
What about him? What's he doing?

333
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,030
我在组装这个  这样就能边干活边听歌了
I'm finishing this so we can listen to tunes while we work.

334
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,060
这怎么重要了
How is that a priority?

335
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,590
怪奎尔啊  是他那么爱听歌
Blame Quill. He's the one who loves music so much.

336
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,570
不  其实我同意德拉克斯
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

337
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,560
现在那个可不重要
That's hardly important right now.

338
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,620
好吧  好啊  奎尔
Okay. Sure, Quill.

339
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,730
不  认真的  我同意德拉克斯
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

340
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,270
我懂  你现在非常认真
No, I understand that. You're being very serious right now.

341
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,630
我能清楚看见你在眨眼
I can clearly see you winking.

342
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,070
该死  我眨的是左眼吗
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

343
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,420
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

344
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,760
他们没斜眼看你
They were not looking at you funny.

345
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,860
要动真格的了
Well, that's intense.

346
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:27,980
格鲁特
Groot!

347
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,690
格鲁特  快闪开  你会受伤的
Groot, get out of the way! You're gonna get hurt!

348
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,010
不不  快吐出来
No! No! Spit it out!

349
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,760
快点
Come on!

350
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,330
真恶心
Disgusting!

351
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,230
这怪物的皮太厚了  从外面刺不穿
The beast's hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside.

352
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,740
必须从里面切穿它
I must cut through it from the inside.

353
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,000
不不  德拉克斯  等等
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

354
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,140
德拉克斯
Drax!

355
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,160
他干什么
What is he doing?

356
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,950
他说皮太厚了
He said the skin is too thick

357
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,290
从外面刺不穿  所以他
to be pierced from the outside, so he...

358
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,010
-这根本没道理  -我想告诉他来着
- That doesn't make any sense! - I tried telling him that!

359
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,200
它的皮不管内外
Skin is the same level of thickness

360
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,790
都一样厚
from the inside as from the outside!

361
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,400
我意识到了
I realize that.

362
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,940
它脖子上有个切口
There is a cut on its neck.

363
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,940
火箭  让它抬头
Rocket, get it to look up.

364
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,890
你个大海猴子  看上面
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!

365
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,090
小心  奎尔
Watch it, Quill!

366
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,010
太棒了  我一个人打败了这头怪物
Yes! I have single-handedly vanquished the beast!

367
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,180
怎么了
What?

368
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,740
它们叫什么来着
What are they called again?

369
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,830
能量电池
Anulax batteries.

370
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,090
棱酿电池
Harbulary batteries.

371
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,450
跟我说的完全不搭边
That's nothing like what I just said.

372
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,190
但它们每个都值几万块
But they're worth thousands of units apiece

373
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,640
所以索维林族雇我们保护它们
which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.

374
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,870
跟这些人打交道小心措辞  他们很容易生气
Careful what you say around these folks. They're easily offended.

375
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,820
冒犯了他们会被处死
The cost of transgression is death.

376
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,740
我们感谢你们拿生命冒险  银河护卫队
We thank you, Guardians, for putting your lives on the line.

377
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,080
我们不能让索维林子民去冒生命危险
We could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens.

378
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,290
每个人都完全是按照族群的设计诞生的
Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community.

379
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,830
身体和头脑都完美无缺
Impeccable, both physically and mentally.

380
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,080
我们控制后代的DNA
We control the DNA of our progeny...

381
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,480
让他们在生育荚里发育
germinating them in birthing pods.

382
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,420
我更喜欢用传统办法造人
I guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.

383
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,360
也许哪天你可以给我讲讲历史
Perhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson...

384
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,170
讲讲我们祖先古老的方法
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

385
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,990
为了学术研究
For academic purposes.

386
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,910
我很荣幸  好的
I would be honored, yes.

387
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,480
以学术研究的名义
In the name of research...

388
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,290
我觉得那会非常
I think that could be pretty...

389
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,680
非常令人反感
pretty repulsive.

390
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,420
我不喜欢随便...
I'm not into that kind of casual...

391
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,600
行了
Oh, please.

392
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,130
你们答应我们出力会有报酬的
Your people promised something in exchange for our services.

393
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,700
拿出来  我们马上就走
Bring it and we shall gladly be on our way.

394
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,700
家人团聚
Family reunion.

395
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,200
我知道她是你妹妹
I understand she is your sister.

396
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,380
她对我来说  只值山达尔的悬赏而已
She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.

397
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,110
她想盗窃电池  被我们的士兵抓了个正着
Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries.

398
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,690
请随意处置她吧
Do with her as you please.

399
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,080
我们非常感谢您  阿耶莎大祭司
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

400
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,260
你是什么出身  奎尔先生
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

401
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,160
我母亲来自地球
My mother is from Earth.

402
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,850
你父亲呢
And your father?

403
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,550
他不是密苏里人  我只知道这些
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.

404
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,640
我在你身上看到了
I see it within you.

405
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,780
一种不同寻常的血统
An unorthodox genealogy.

406
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,270
这种混血看起来特别...
A hybrid that seems particularly...

407
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,630
鲁莽
reckless.

408
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,640
你知道吗  我听说你们都是自以为是的混蛋
You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags...

409
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,580
但那完全不是事实
but that isn't true at all.

410
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,190
糟糕
Oh, shit.

411
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,680
我又用错眼睛了  是吗
I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?

412
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,070
我很抱歉  我没想被你发现的
I'm sorry. That was meant to be behind your back.

413
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,270
他们没杀你算你走运
Count yourself blessed they didn't kill you.

414
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,620
还用你说
You're telling me.

415
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,750
你想买点电池吗
You wanna buy some batteries?

416
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,250
好吧  我们把小秃子送去山达尔领赏吧
All right, let's get baldy to Xandar and collect that bounty.

417
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,380
她说我父亲的那些话
That stuff about my father...

418
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,470
她以为她是谁啊
Who does she think she is?

419
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,990
我知道你对那件事有点敏感
I know you're sensitive about that.

420
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,800
我才没有敏感  我只是不知道他是什么人
I'm not sensitive about it. I just don't know who he is.

421
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,220
如果我看起来像是在跟大祭司调情那很抱歉
Sorry if it seemed like I was flirting with the High Priestess.

422
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,700
我没那个意思
I wasn't.

423
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,140
即使你有我也不在意
I don't care if you were.

424
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,560
我觉得你在意
Well, I feel like you do care.

425
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,700
所以我在道歉  对不起
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

426
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,220
卡魔拉不适合你  奎尔
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

427
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,800
鬼鬼祟祟的
Damn shadow.

428
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,120
宇宙中有两种人
There are two types of beings in the universe...

429
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,100
一种是跳舞的人  另一种是不跳舞的人
those who dance, and those who do not.

430
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,540
我第一次见到我的爱人是在一场战争集会上
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

431
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,450
天哪
Oh, God.

432
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,820
村子里每个人都在跳舞
Everyone in the village flailed about, dancing.

433
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,200
除了一个女人
Except one woman.

434
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,970
我的奥薇特
My Ovette.

435
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,140
我立刻就知道她是我的真命天女
I knew immediately she was the one for me.

436
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,990
即使听着最有旋律的音乐
The most melodic song in the world could be playing.

437
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,520
她连脚都不会点一下
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

438
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,830
动都不会动一下
Wouldn't move a muscle.

439
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,140
看上去就像是死了
One might assume she was dead.

440
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,330
听起来很性感
That does sound pretty hot.

441
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,890
我下面都要充血了
It would make my nether regions engorge.

442
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,920
好吧  我懂了  没错
Okay. I get it, yes.

443
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,510
我是个舞者  而卡魔拉不是
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

444
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,460
你只需要找到一个跟你一样不着调的女人
You just need to find a woman who is pathetic... like you.

445
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,370
我饿了  那些亚罗根给我来点
I'm hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.

446
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,230
不行  还没熟
No. It's not ripe yet...

447
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,110
而且我恨你
and I hate you.

448
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,220
你恨我
You hate me?

449
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,260
你丢下了我  自己去偷那块石头了
You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself.

450
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,850
而现在你却像个英雄一样
And yet here you stand, a hero.

451
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,730
很快我就能摆脱这枷锁
I will be free of these shackles soon enough,

452
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,090
然后我会杀了你
and I will kill you.

453
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,330
我发誓
I swear.

454
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,280
不
No.

455
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,440
你会在山达尔的监狱里
You're gonna live out the rest of your days

456
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,780
度过余生
in a prison on Xandar...

457
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,290
做那个白日梦
wishing you could.

458
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,440
奇怪
This is weird.

459
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,550
有一队索维林飞船从后面追上来了
We've got a Sovereign fleet approaching from the rear.

460
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,650
他们为什么要这样
Why would they do that?

461
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,560
可能是因为火箭偷了他们几个电池
Probably because Rocket stole some of their batteries.

462
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,570
老兄
Dude!

463
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,870
哦
Right.

464
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,480
他没偷电池
He didn't steal some of those.

465
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,670
我不知道他们为什么追我们  真奇怪啊
I don't know why they're after us. What a mystery this is.

466
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,850
你怎么想的
What were you thinking?

467
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,790
哥们  那些电池真的很容易偷
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

468
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,270
-这就是你的辩解  -拜托
- That's your defense? - Come on!

469
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,820
你看到那个大祭司高高在上的样子了
You saw how that High Priestess talked down to us.

470
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,490
我这是在教训她
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

471
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,020
我没想到你的动机这么无私
I didn't realize your motivation was altruism.

472
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,090
真是遗憾啊
It's really a shame

473
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,500
那些索维林人没领会到你的好意
the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions...

474
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,410
-还想杀掉我们  -说的太对了
- and they're trying to kill us. - Exactly!

475
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,260
我是在讽刺你
I was being sarcastic!

476
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:53,910
不
Oh, no!

477
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,250
你应该用讽刺的语气  这下我出丑了
You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!

478
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,360
斗嘴先省省好不好
Can we put the bickering on hold

479
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,940
活过这场太空大战再说
until after we survive this massive space battle?

480
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,470
-更多敌人朝我们来了  -很好
- More incoming! - Good!

481
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,250
我想杀杀人
I wanna kill some guys!

482
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,430
你谁也没杀掉
You're not killing anyone.

483
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,400
这些飞船都是遥控驾驶的
All those ships are remotely piloted.

484
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,620
该死
Damn it!

485
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,180
在磨蹭什么  舰队司令
What is the delay, Admiral?

486
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,120
大祭司  那些电池
High Priestess, the batteries,

487
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,120
它们极其易燃
they are exceptionally combustible...

488
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,580
可能会摧毁整个舰队
and could destroy the entire fleet.

489
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,580
我们在意的是他们对我们的不敬
Our concern is their slight against our people.

490
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,370
我们雇佣了他们  他们却偷我们的
We hired them and they steal from us.

491
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,680
这是最大的亵渎
It is heresy of the highest order.

492
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,670
所有操作单位
All command modules...

493
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,820
对目标格杀勿论
fire with the intent to kill.

494
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,150
最近的宜居星球是哪里
What's the nearest habitable planet?

495
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,330
是一个叫博赫特的星球
It's called Berhert.

496
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,340
-需要几次星际跳跃  -只要一次
- How many jumps? - Only one.

497
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,840
但进入点在47公里外
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

498
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,190
而且你得穿过那片量子小行星群
And you have to go through that quantum asteroid field.

499
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,710
奎尔  要想穿过那里
Quill, to make it through that

500
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,870
你得是全宇宙最棒的飞行员
you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.

501
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,230
那我们走运了
Lucky for us,

502
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,850
-我就...  -我就是
- I... - I am.

503
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,370
你在干什么
What are you doing?

504
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,570
我从十岁就开始开这玩意了
I've been flying this rig since I was 10 years old.

505
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,520
我就是为开宇宙飞船而设计制造的
I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft.

506
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,260
你就是设计制造成了个混蛋
You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag!

507
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,680
-别闹了  -奎尔
- Stop it. - Quill.

508
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,800
今天晚上  你躺在床上的时候
Later on tonight, you're gonna be laying down in your bed

509
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,860
你的枕套里会有黏糊糊的一坨
and there's gonna be something squishy in your pillow case.

510
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,290
你会想"这是什么"
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"

511
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,090
那会是我放的一坨屎
And it's gonna be because I put a turd in there!

512
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,370
你敢把你的屎放我床上  我就剃光你
You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.

513
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,110
才不会放我的
It won't be my turd.

514
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,590
我会放德拉克斯的
It will be Drax's.

515
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,140
我的屎蛋出了名的大
I have famously huge turds.

516
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,620
我们都快要死了  现在就讨论这个吗
We're about to die, and this is what we're discussing?

517
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,120
混蛋
Son of a...

518
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,950
哥们  搞什么
Dude! Seriously!

519
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,360
我来...
Let me...

520
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,290
蠢货
Idiots!

521
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,720
奎尔开飞船就这下场
Well, that's what you get when Quill flies.

522
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,790
还有一架索维林飞船在追我们
We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.

523
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,020
我们武器坏了
Our weapons are down.

524
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,620
还有20公里跳跃
Twenty clicks to the jump!

525
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,950
坐稳了
Hold on.

526
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,240
还没熟呢
It's not ripe.

527
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,240
加油  扎莱克  你可以的
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

528
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,830
太棒了
Yes!

529
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,180
还有15公里跳跃
Fifteen clicks to the jump!

530
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,060
加油
Come on!

531
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,990
继续
Keep going!

532
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,120
还有10公里
Ten clicks!

533
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,540
去死吧  破船
Die, spaceship!

534
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,590
你弱爆了  扎莱克
You suck, Zylak.

535
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,620
不出所料
Typical.

536
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,740
还有五公里
Five clicks!

537
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,710
混蛋
Son of a...

538
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,960
他们绕过了星群
They went around the field!

539
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,090
有人摧毁了我们所有的飞船
Someone destroyed all our ships!

540
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,740
什么
What?

541
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,840
是谁
Who?

542
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,100
还有一公里
One click!

543
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,780
-那是什么  -管他呢
- What is that? - Who cares?

544
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,190
跳跃点就在那儿  快  快
That's the jump point! Go! Go!

545
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,200
那是个人
It's a guy.

546
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,340
天啊
Oh, my God.

547
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,670
他还在外面吗
He's still out there?

548
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,470
格鲁特  系好安全带
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

549
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,200
准备好要强行降落了
Prepare for a really bad landing!

550
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,280
刚才太赞了
That was awesome!

551
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,190
棒
Yes!

552
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,280
你看看
Look at this!

553
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,000
咱们飞船的另一半呢
Where is the other half of our ship?

554
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,830
是我的船
My ship.

555
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,840
你们任何一个都可以带我们平安穿过星群
Either one of you could have gotten us through that field...

556
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,730
如果你们肯用上面这个
had you flown with what's between your ears

557
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,370
而不是下面那个驾驶飞船
instead of what's between your legs!

558
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,340
如果我下面那个长了手
If what's between my legs had a hand on it...

559
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,340
那我绝对可以用它来降落飞船
I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.

560
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,160
彼得
Peter,

561
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,330
我们差点被你的傲慢害死
we almost died because of your arrogance.

562
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:39,730
是因为他偷能量电池还差不多
More like because he stole the Anulax batteries!

563
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,100
那个叫棱酿电池
They're called Harbulary batteries.

564
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,500
不  不叫那个 
No, they're not!

565
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,970
你知道我为什么那么做吗  星嚼
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch?

566
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,670
我才不叫星嚼
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

567
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,750
因为我乐意
I did it because I wanted to!

568
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,350
混蛋
Dick.

569
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,650
我们为什么要讨论这个
What are we even talking about this for?

570
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,650
刚才有个小人炸了五十艘飞船救了我们
We just had a little man save us by blowing up 50 ships!

571
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,660
有多小
How little?

572
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,670
我也不知道  大概这么小
Well, I don't know, like this?

573
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,680
一个一英寸的小人救了我们吗
A little one-inch man saved us?

574
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,000
他要是近一点  肯定就会大一点吧
Well, if he got closer, I'm sure he would be much larger.

575
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,360
那叫近大远小  你个傻浣熊
That's how eyesight works, you stupid raccoon.

576
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,100
别叫我浣熊
Don't call me a raccoon!

577
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,660
抱歉  是我过分了
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

578
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,120
我是想说垃圾熊猫
I meant trash panda.

579
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,310
那样好听点吗
Is that better?

580
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,840
我不知道
I don't know.

581
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,200
这个更损  这个损多了
It's worse. It's so much worse.

582
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,650
你个混蛋
You son of a...

583
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,950
-我受够你了  -别过来
- I've had it with you! - No! Back up!

584
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,980
有人从跳跃点跟着你们来了
Someone followed you through the jump point.

585
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,160
放了我  你们需要我帮忙
Set me free, you'll need my help.

586
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,000
我又不傻  星云
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

587
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,090
如果在战斗中拒绝帮助就是犯傻
You are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.

588
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,860
我一放了你  你就会攻击我的
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.

589
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,660
我不会的
No, I won't.

590
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,200
你这种超级大坏蛋不是应该很会说谎吗
You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.

591
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,210
我赌是那个一英寸的小人
I bet it's the one-inch man.

592
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,670
时隔这么多年  我终于找到你了
After all these years, I've found you.

593
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,280
你到底是谁
And who the hell are you?

594
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,260
我以为我沧桑帅气的外表就足以说明了
I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious.

595
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,550
我叫伊戈
My name is Ego...

596
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,140
我是你爸爸  彼得
and I'm your dad, Peter.

597
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,600
你知道俗话怎么说的
You know what they say...

598
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,330
"跟过鸭鸭  好运就来"
"You're out of luck until you've gone duck."

599
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,320
勇度
Yondu!

600
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,350
快下来
Come on down!

601
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:36,140
兜兜转转这么多年
After going around years in circles...

602
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,680
跟我最终娶的这女人周旋
with this woman I end up marrying.

603
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,440
我说  "艾丽塔  我爱你
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

604
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,030
但你真是疯了"
"But you're losing your mind!"

605
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,030
话说回来  她一直都那样
Then again, she's always been that way.

606
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,710
我从来都不能相信她
I could never trust her. You know?

607
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,390
斯塔卡
Stakar.

608
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,790
好久不见
It's been some time.

609
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,170
看来这个场子
It seems like this establishment

610
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,520
堕落错了方式
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

611
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,510
-先生  -斯塔卡
- Sir! - Stakar!

612
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,860
掠夺者有一百个派系
There's a hundred Ravager factions.

613
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,190
你为了接待其中一个  而失去了剩下99个的
You lost the business of 99 of them by serving one.

614
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,840
求你了  先生  别走
Please, sir. Please!

615
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,650
-别碰我  -求你
- Get away from me. - Please!

616
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:24,800
你下地狱吧
You can go to hell then!

617
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,940
我不在乎你怎么看我
I don't give a damn what you think of me!

618
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,690
那你跟着我们干什么
So what are you following us for?

619
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:31,320
因为你必须听我说
Because you're gonna listen to what I gotta say!

620
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,550
我什么都不用听  是你背叛了准则
I don't gotta listen to nothing! You betrayed the code!

621
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,590
掠夺者不买卖孩子
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

622
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,370
我告诉过你  我不知道是怎么回事
I told you before! I didn't know what was going on!

623
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,140
你不知道
You didn't know

624
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,120
是因为你不想知道
because you didn't want to know

625
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,200
因为你靠这个发财
because it made you rich.

626
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,900
我要求有一席之地  我跟你们一样佩戴焰标
I demand a seat at the table! I wear these flames, same as you.

627
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,330
你虽然穿得像我们
You may dress like us...

628
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,420
但你死后别想听到自由号角声  勇度
but you'll never hear the Horns of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

629
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,770
奥戈尔的颜色
And the Colors of Ogord...

630
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,740
也绝不会在你的墓上闪耀
will never flash over your grave.

631
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,620
要是你觉得
If you think...

632
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,180
流放你  让我高兴
I take pleasure in exiling you...

633
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,770
那你就错了
you're wrong.

634
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,810
你伤了我们所有人的心
You broke all our hearts.

635
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,150
可悲
Pathetic.

636
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,890
起先  奎尔背叛了我们
First, Quill betrays us...

637
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,130
结果勇度把他毫发无伤地放走了
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

638
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,140
我们跟随他  是因为他
We followed him because he was the one

639
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,890
敢做不得不做的事
who wasn't afraid to do what needed to be done.

640
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,330
看来他变软弱了
Seems he's goin' soft.

641
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,990
要是他软弱  你这么小声干吗
If he's so soft, why are you whispering for?

642
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,360
你知道我说得对  克拉林
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

643
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,620
小心点  怎么说我们船长呢
You best be very careful what you say about our captain.

644
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,350
这是谁
Who the hell is that?

645
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,360
勇度·尤冬塔
Yondu Udonta...

646
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,870
我有个提议
I have a proposition for you.

647
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,930
你母亲去世后
I hired Yondu to pick you up

648
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,780
我雇了勇度去接你
when your mother passed away.

649
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,930
但他没有把你还给我
But instead of returning you...

650
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,420
而是把你留下了
Yondu kept you.

651
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,150
我不知道为什么
I have no clue as to why.

652
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,930
我告诉你为什么
Well, I'll tell you why.

653
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,620
因为我是个瘦得皮包骨的小孩
Because I was a skinny little kid

654
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,320
能溜进成年人进不去的地方
who could squeeze into places adults couldn't.

655
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,010
偷东西更容易
It made it easier for thievin'.

656
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,440
从那时起  我就一直在寻找你的下落
Well, I've been trying to track you down ever since.

657
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,370
我还以为勇度是你父亲
I thought Yondu was your father.

658
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,740
什么  我们在一起这么久
What? We've been together this whole time

659
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,370
你以为勇度是我的血亲
and you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?

660
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,180
你俩长得一模一样
You look exactly alike.

661
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,800
勇度是蓝的
One's blue!

662
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,280
不  他不是我父亲
No, he's not my father!

663
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,370
勇度绑架了我
Yondu was the guy who abducted me

664
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,520
把我打得满地找牙  让我学会怎么打架
kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight

665
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,150
威胁要吃了我  让我一直担惊受怕
and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.

666
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,720
-吃了你  -是啊
- Eat you? - Yeah.

667
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,580
那个王八蛋
That son of a bitch.

668
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,340
你怎么找到我们的
How'd you locate us now?

669
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,960
哪怕像我住得那么偏僻
Even where I reside, out past the edge of what's known

670
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,770
也听说过传说中的星爵
we've heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord.

671
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,660
我们现在就出发去那儿怎么样
What say we head out there right now?

672
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,200
欢迎你的伙伴一起去
Your associates are welcome.

673
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,220
包括那只三角脸猴子
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

674
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,780
我保证
I promise you...

675
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,640
那是一个与众不同的地方
it's unlike any other place you've ever seen.

676
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,120
在那里
And there...

677
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:51,040
我能给你解释你特别的身世
I can explain your very special heritage.

678
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,590
终于能做
Finally get to be the...

679
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,580
我一直想做的那个父亲了
father I've always wanted to be.

680
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,020
失陪了
Excuse me.

681
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,370
我去撒泡尿
I've gotta take a whiz.

682
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,880
我不信
I'm not buying it.

683
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,830
我们去散步吧
Let's go take a walk.

684
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,510
我叫螳螂
I am Mantis.

685
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,520
你在干什么
What are you doing?

686
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,040
微笑
Smiling.

687
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,130
我听说  这样做能让人们喜欢你
I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.

688
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,270
你那么笑可不能
Not if you do it like that.

689
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,320
我一个人在伊戈的星球上长大
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

690
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,300
我不了解人际交流的微妙
I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction.

691
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,940
我能摸摸你的狗狗吗  它好可爱
Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.

692
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,460
可以
Yes.

693
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,610
这叫恶作剧
That is called a practical joke!

694
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,090
我很喜欢
I liked it very much!

695
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,240
是我刚想的
I just made it up!

696
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,460
饶了我吧
Give me a break!

697
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,020
都过了这么久了  突然出现
After all this time, you're gonna show up,

698
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,830
-还突然要当我爸  -是啊
- and just all of a sudden you wanna be my dad? - I hear you.

699
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,190
另外  这可能是个陷阱  好吗
And by the way, this could be a trap. Okay?

700
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,910
克里纯种主义者  掠夺者
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

701
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,990
-都想杀死我们  -我知道  但是
- they all want us dead. - I know, but...

702
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,910
但是什么
But what?

703
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,710
你给我讲的扎渡·霍索妇的故事呢
What was that story you told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?

704
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,570
谁
Who?

705
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,260
有一艘魔法船的那个
He owned a magic boat?

706
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,310
大卫·霍索夫
David Hasselhoff?

707
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:38,940
就是他
Right.

708
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,440
不是魔法船  是会说话的车
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

709
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,720
为什么会说话来着
Why did he talk again?

710
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,200
为了帮他打击犯罪  并给予精神支持
To help him fight crime, and to be supportive.

711
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,940
你小时候会随身带着他的照片
As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket

712
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,970
告诉其他小孩
and you would tell all the other children

713
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,410
说他是你父亲  但他出门了
that he was your father, but that he was out of town.

714
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,010
拍摄《霹雳游侠》或者跟乐队在德国巡回演出
Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany.

715
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,380
那是我喝醉时告诉你的
I told you that when I was drunk.

716
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,600
你现在提它干吗
Why are you bringing that up now?

717
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,820
我喜欢那个故事
I love that story.

718
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,640
我讨厌那个故事
I hate that story.

719
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:03,350
太可悲了
It's so sad!

720
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,440
我小时候总是看着其他孩子
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids off

721
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,600
跟他们的爸爸玩投接球
playing catch with their dad. And I

722
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,690
我也想让爸爸陪我玩  那是我最大的心愿
I wanted that, more than anything in the world!

723
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,530
我就想说这个  彼得
That's my point, Peter.

724
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,770
如果这个人就是你的霍索夫呢
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

725
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,870
听着  如果我们发现他是坏人
Listen, if he ends up being evil...

726
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,130
那就杀了他
we will just kill him.

727
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
你要把我丢给那只狐狸
You're leaving me with that fox?

728
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,560
他不是狐狸
He's not a fox.

729
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,780
要是她行为可疑  就开枪打她
Shoot her if she does anything suspicious.

730
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,710
-或者你想打就打  -好
- Or if you feel like it. - Okay.

731
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,120
就几天而已
It'll be just a couple of days.

732
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,740
还没等火箭修好飞船  我们就能回来了
We'll be back before Rocket's finished fixing the ship.

733
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,290
要是索维林人来了怎么办
What if the Sovereign come?

734
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,610
他们不可能知道我们在这儿  走吧
There's no way for them to know we're here. Let's go.

735
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,850
我觉得兵分两路不太好
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

736
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,240
天啊  你就像个老太婆
God, you're like an old woman.

737
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,980
因为我睿智吗
Because I'm wise?

738
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,060
你怎么有这么多行李
Why do you have so much luggage?

739
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,030
我不想让格鲁特乱动我的东西
I don't want Groot playing with my things.

740
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,950
希望老爸不像你那么混蛋  小孤儿
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.

741
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,520
你的目的是什么  让所有人都讨厌你吗
What is your goal here? To get everybody to hate you?

742
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,320
你成功了
Because it's working.

743
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,150
我能问你个私人问题吗
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

744
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,070
还没人问过我私人问题呢
No one has ever asked me a personal question.

745
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,710
你的触角是干什么的
Your antennae, what are they for?

746
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,460
触角的用途
Their purpose?

747
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,420
对  奎尔和我打了个赌
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

748
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,310
哥们  你不应该说出来的
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

749
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,530
我说
I say...

750
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,160
当你要穿过一个很低的门框时
that if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low...

751
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:28,730
你的触角能感知高度
your antennae will feel this,

752
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:30,350
防止你撞掉脑袋
and keep you from being decapitated.

753
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,060
对  如果是任何
Right. And if it's anything other than

754
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,090
防止掉脑袋之外的用途  那我赢
you specifically not being decapitated by a doorway, I win.

755
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,420
它们不是感知门框用的
They are not for feeling doorways.

756
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,560
我觉得
I think...

757
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,020
它们跟我的共情能力有关
they have something to do with my empathic abilities.

758
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,190
那是什么
What are those?

759
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,410
我触碰别人时  我能感觉到他们的感受
If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings.

760
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,470
-你会读心术  -不是
- You read minds? - No.

761
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,740
心灵感应是感知想法
Telepaths know thoughts.

762
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,390
共情是感知感情
Empaths feel feelings.

763
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,220
情绪
Emotions.

764
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,210
可以吗
May I?

765
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,700
好
All right.

766
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,030
你怀着爱
You feel love.

767
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,320
是的  我怀着一种
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,

768
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,730
-对所有人的无私的大爱  -不
- unselfish love for just about everybody. - No!

769
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,200
是浪漫的  肉欲的爱
Romantic, sexual love.

770
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,390
我才没
No, I don't.

771
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,070
-爱的是她  -不
- For her! - No!

772
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,280
不是
That is not...

773
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:31,990
好吧
Okay.

774
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:38,140
她把你最不可告人的秘密说出来了
She just told everyone your deepest, darkest secret!

775
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,160
哥们  拜托  你有点反应过度了
Dude, come on, I think you're overreacting a little bit!

776
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,540
你肯定尴尬死了
You must be so embarrassed!

777
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,250
来感知一下我  试试我
Do me! Do me! Do me!

778
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,540
我从来没感觉过如此的幽默
I have never felt such humor!

779
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,410
真是讨厌到难以置信
So unbelievably uncool.

780
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,250
奎尔
Quill.

781
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,510
敢摸我  你就只能感觉到下巴骨折
Touch me, and the only thing you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

782
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:20,150
我也可以稍微改变人的情绪
I can also alter emotions to some extent.

783
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,340
比如
Yeah, like what?

784
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,830
如果我碰到悲伤的人
If I touch someone who is sad...

785
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,560
我可以安抚他们  让他们获得暂时的满足感
I can ease them into contentment for a short while.

786
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,250
我可以让固执的人变顺从
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

787
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,630
但我主要用我的能力帮助主人入睡
But I mostly use it to help my master sleep.

788
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,370
他夜里想着后代  无法入睡
He lies awake at night thinking about his progeny.

789
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,420
在我身上试试那个
Do one of those on me.

790
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,990
睡吧
Sleep.

791
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,650
我喜欢这首歌
I love this song.

792
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,640
在那儿
There!

793
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,740
没了那些玩具  你就没那么厉害了吧
Ain't so tough now without all your toys...

794
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,640
是不是
are you?

795
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
闪开
Move!

796
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,810
糟了
Crap.

797
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,980
好啊  耗子
Hey there, rat!

798
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,150
你好吗  你个蓝蠢货
How's it going, you blue idiot?

799
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,540
还不错
Not so bad.

800
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,820
我们接了一份美差
We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here.

801
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:20,450
有个自命不凡的金闪闪的姑娘
This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself has

802
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,190
给我们开出很高的价码
offered us a large sum

803
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,870
要我们抓到你和你的同伴交给她
to deliver you and your pals over to her

804
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,690
因为她想杀了你们
because she wants to kill y'all.

805
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,570
你的朋友
Your friend...

806
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,580
敌人太多了
There's too many of them.

807
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,330
他需要我帮忙  要是你在乎他
He needs my help. If you care about him...

808
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,280
你得帮我解开手铐
you need to get me out of these bonds.

809
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,260
他们会杀了他的
They are going to kill him!

810
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,820
告诉你  找到你可容易了
I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.

811
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,720
山达尔大战的时候  我在你们飞船上
I put a tracer on your ship back there

812
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,430
放了个追踪器
during the war over Xandar.

813
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,830
你保证不伤害格鲁特
Give me your word you won't hurt Groot...

814
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,310
我就告诉你电池在哪
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.

815
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,600
你真走运  我说话不算数
Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.

816
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,570
不然我就把你们交出去了
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

817
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,490
不然你就什么
Otherwise, you'd what?

818
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,630
我们把电池拿走
We'll take them batteries.

819
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:03,050
它们值多少  在市场上能卖个25万
They're worth what? A quarter mill on the open market?

820
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,630
那个祭司答应给我们一百万
That Priestess offered us a million.

821
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,630
25万才三分之一
A quarter is only one third of that!

822
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,880
25万不是三分之一
A quarter ain't a third.

823
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,090
25万就是25
A quarter is 25.

824
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:12,740
不是
No.

825
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,460
25连双靴子都卖不来
We can't even buy a pair of boots with 25 units.

826
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,430
够了
Enough!

827
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,390
重点是  我们没那么蠢
The point is, we ain't stupid enough

828
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,840
会帮忙把银河护卫队杀掉
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

829
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,380
整个新星军团都不会放过我们的
The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.

830
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,990
这样不对
That ain't right!

831
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,640
我就说这一次  船长
I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.

832
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,990
不管奎尔背叛你几次
No matter how many times Quill betrays you

833
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,830
你都会保护他  就好像我们其他人都不重要
you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!

834
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,900
是啊
Yeah!

835
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,850
我才是会支持你的人
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

836
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,690
别激动  克拉林
Take it easy, Kraglin.

837
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,600
说对了  伙计  他是心变软了
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

838
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,800
或许改换个领导人了
Suppose it's time for a change in leadership.

839
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,860
放下你们的枪
Put your damn guns down!

840
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,910
这事肯定是可以和平解决的  各位
There must be some kind of peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

841
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,720
哪怕是武力解决也好  只要我站那边
Or even a violent one where I'm standing over there.

842
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,780
你们好啊  小伙子们
Well, hello, boys.

843
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,740
没熟
It's not ripe.

844
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,060
各位  欢迎来到我的世界
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

845
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,110
你有自己的星球
You have your own planet?

846
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:23,380
没什么的  也不比地球的月亮大
Come on. No larger than your Earth's Moon.

847
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,010
谦逊
Humility.

848
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,550
我喜欢
I like it.

849
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,850
我也是个非常谦虚的人
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

850
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,330
你有自己的星球
You own a planet

851
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,130
还能不穿太空服就干掉几十艘飞船
and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit.

852
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,360
你究竟是什么人
What are you exactly?

853
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:23,090
我是所谓的天神  亲爱的
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.

854
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,140
天神  你是个神吗
A Celestial, like a god?

855
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,500
就是个普通神  儿子
Small "G," Son.

856
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,800
至少在我跟德拉克斯一样谦逊的日子里是的
At least on the days I'm feeling humble as Drax.

857
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:51,530
我也不知道我究竟从哪来
I don't know where I came from exactly.

858
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,180
我最初的记忆是闪烁
First thing I remember is flickering

859
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:56,430
漂浮在宇宙中
adrift in the cosmos utterly

860
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,470
完全孤独地存在着
and entirely alone.

861
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:02,710
经历了数百万年
Over millions of years

862
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:06,480
我学会了控制我周围的分子
I learned to control the molecules around me.

863
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:10,040
我越来越聪明  越来越强大
I grew smarter and stronger.

864
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,950
我不断地建造着
And I continued building from there...

865
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,830
一层又一层
layer by layer...

866
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,850
最终建成了你们现在脚下的星球
the very planet you walk on now.

867
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:23,370
但我不满足
But I wanted more.

868
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,480
我渴望
I desired...

869
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,320
意义
meaning.

870
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,360
我想着  这宇宙中肯定还有
"There must be some life out there in the universe...

871
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,690
我之外的生命
"Besides just me," I thought.

872
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,470
于是  我立志要找到生命
And so, I set myself the task of finding it.

873
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,580
我创造了
I created...

874
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,360
我所想象的生物生命
what I imagined biological life to be like...

875
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:49,620
包括最细微的细节
down to the most minute detail.

876
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:51,970
你做老二了吗
Did you make a penis?

877
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:52,840
哥们
Dude!

878
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,300
你什么毛病啊
What is wrong with you?

879
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,990
如果他是个星球  怎么能跟你母亲造人啊
If he is a planet, how could he make a baby with your mother?

880
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,550
他会压扁她的
He would smush her!

881
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,480
我不想听我父母是怎么...
I don't need to hear how my parents...

882
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,550
为什么
Why?

883
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,990
我父亲每年冬至
My father would tell the story of

884
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:09,980
都会讲述他让我母亲怀孕的故事
impregnating my mother every winter solstice.

885
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,130
太恶心了
That's disgusting.

886
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,970
那很美
It was beautiful.

887
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,940
你们地球人真有病
You Earthers have hang-ups.

888
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,930
是啊  德拉克斯  我有老二
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

889
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,500
谢谢
Thank you!

890
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,960
而且不赖
It's not half bad.

891
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:27,080
我还有痛觉  消化系统
I've also got pain receptors, and a digestive system and

892
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:29,570
和所有附带的一切
all the accompanying junk.

893
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:34,140
我想真正地体验为人
I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human

894
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,940
于是我探索群星
as I set out amongst the stars...

895
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,830
直到我找到了
until I found...

896
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,460
我所寻找的
what I sought.

897
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,390
生命
Life.

898
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,580
我在这宇宙中终究不是孤独的
I was not alone in the universe after all.

899
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,130
你什么时候认识我母亲的
When did you meet my mother?

900
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,930
不久之后
Not long after.

901
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:13,880
是梅瑞狄斯让我第一次体验了爱
It was with Meredith that I first experienced love.

902
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,240
我
I

903
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,820
喊她我的水百合
called her my river lily.

904
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,330
那份爱  彼得
And from that love, Peter...

905
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,140
创造了你
you.

906
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,580
我找了你好久
I have searched for you for so long.

907
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,600
当我听说一个地球人
And when I heard of a man from Earth

908
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,850
手握无限宝石还能不死
who held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying...

909
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,140
我就知道你一定是我所爱的女人的儿子
I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved.

910
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,720
如果你爱她  为什么要离开她
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

911
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,510
这是哗变
This is mutiny!

912
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,190
这是哗变
This is mutiny!

913
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,220
这是哗变
This is mutiny!

914
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,110
你们这些渣滓
You're scum!

915
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:17,850
船长
Captain!

916
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:20,610
救我啊
Help me! Please!

917
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:21,670
船长
Captain!

918
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,490
是你害死了那些人
You're the one what killed those men

919
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,830
你领他们走错了路
by leading them down the wrong path.

920
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,870
因为你软弱
Because you're weak.

921
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,920
还愚蠢
And stupid!

922
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,490
现在  掠夺者
It's time for the Ravagers

923
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:44,520
要再次恢复荣誉  追随新船长
to rise once again to glory with a new captain...

924
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:47,900
电击脸
Taserface!

925
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:57,890
抱歉  抱歉  你名叫
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Your name is...

926
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,770
电击脸
It's Taserface?

927
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,210
没错
That's right.

928
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,410
你的脸有电击能力吗
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

929
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,040
是个比喻
It's metaphorical!

930
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,440
是啊
Yeah!

931
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,340
比喻什么
For what?

932
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,930
比喻
For

933
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,330
这个名字能让任何
it is a name what strikes fear

934
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:20,330
听到它的人  心生恐惧
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

935
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:23,910
嗯
Okay.

936
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:25,940
好吧
Okay...

937
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,320
随你说吧
whatever you say.

938
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:28,960
你闭嘴
You shut up.

939
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,120
你就是下一个
You're next.

940
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:35,350
尤冬塔  我等了好久...
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...

941
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:36,160
怎么了
What?

942
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:40,480
对不起  真对不起
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

943
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,350
我就是一直在想象  先生  你早上醒来
I just keep imagining you waking up in the morning, sir,

944
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,210
看着镜子
looking in the mirror

945
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,530
严肃地对自己说
and then in all seriousness saying to yourself,

946
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:51,550
"知道什么名字特别拽吗  电击脸"
"You know what would be a really kick-ass name? Taserface!"

947
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,980
我想象你就是这样
That's how I hear you in my head!

948
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,340
你的第二选择是什么
What was your second choice?

949
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,020
阴囊帽吗
Scrotum Hat?

950
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,360
新计划  我们先杀你
New plan. We're killing you first.

951
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:06,260
好吧
Well,

952
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,980
死也比做一辈子的
dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life

953
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,950
混蛋白痴  觉得电击脸很酷强
as a moronic shitbag who thinks Taserface is a cool name.

954
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:16,660
今天就杀到这儿吧
That's enough killing for today.

955
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,240
她是灭霸的女儿
She's the daughter of Thanos.

956
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:27,160
我以为你是银河系头号的施虐狂
I thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy.

957
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,370
那是爸爸雇我的时候
That was when Daddy was paying my bills.

958
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,640
大祭司想亲手杀了那狐狸
The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself.

959
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,100
而至少有12个克里省在通缉他
And he has bounties on his head in at least 12 Kree provinces.

960
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,700
我保证
I assure you...

961
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,850
我可不像离了魔法棍子的老头子
I am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick...

962
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:44,810
或会说话的森林野兽那么好对付
or a talking woodland beast.

963
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,990
我要10%的赏金
I want 10% of the take...

964
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,660
还有几样东西
and a couple more things.

965
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,920
我们有一整盒的手
We got a whole box of hands...

966
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,320
-如果那个不行的话  -挺好的
- if that one don't work out. - It is fine.

967
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,460
你觉得克里人会处死船长吗
You think them Kree is gonna execute the captain?

968
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,170
克里人自视仁慈  不会让他痛苦的
The Kree consider themselves merciful. It will be painless.

969
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:08,460
就在这儿  这是我们最好的一艘船
Well, here it is. It's the best ship we got.

970
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,460
伊戈星球的位置发到导航里了
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

971
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,700
等我们拿到钱就把那10%汇给你
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

972
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,780
你打算拿你的那份做什么
What are you gonna do with your share?

973
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:17,210
我还是孩子时  我父亲会让
As a child, my father would have

974
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,770
我和卡魔拉在训练中对打
Gamora and me battle one another in training.

975
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,050
每次我姐姐赢了
Every time my sister prevailed

976
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,160
我父亲就会把我身体的一部分换成机械
my father would replace a piece of me with machinery

977
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,470
他说是希望我能像她一样强
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

978
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,930
但她总赢
But she won...

979
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:37,790
一次又一次  从没一次手下留情
again and again, and again, never once refraining.

980
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,880
所以等我杀了我姐姐
So after I murder my sister...

981
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,080
我要买一艘战舰  装上所有杀戮武器
I will buy a warship with every conceivable instrument of death.

982
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,510
我要像抓狗一样找到我父亲
I will hunt my father like a dog,

983
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:48,680
然后慢慢把他撕碎
and I will tear him apart slowly

984
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,390
一块一块地拆开
piece by piece...

985
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:54,010
直到他能稍有体会我每一天所经历的
until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain

986
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:57,100
无休止的深刻痛苦
I know every single day.

987
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,050
哦
Yeah.

988
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,900
我想的是买条漂亮项链什么的
I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace.

989
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,220
或是好看的帽子
Or a nice hat. You know,

990
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:08,650
让其他姑娘都说  "哎呀  真漂亮"
something to make the other girls go, "Ooh, that's nice!"

991
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,060
总之  一路顺风
Anyways, happy trails.

992
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:26,240
我母亲跟所有人说我父亲来自星星
My mother told everyone my father was from the stars.

993
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,970
她有脑瘤  所以大家都以为她是在妄想
She had brain cancer, so everyone thought she was delusional.

994
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:31,810
彼得
Peter...

995
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,400
听着  我真的很想相信这一切
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this, I really would.

996
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:38,380
但你离开了这世上最棒的女人
But you left the most wonderful woman ever

997
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,190
让她孤独离世
to die alone.

998
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:43,720
我并不想离开你母亲的  彼得
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.

999
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:46,350
如果我不定期回到我的星球
If I don't return regularly to my planet

1000
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:47,760
回归其内部的光
and the light within it

1001
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:49,370
这个人形将退化消逝
this form will wither and perish.

1002
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:51,720
那你为什么不回来  你为什么叫勇度去
So why didn't you come back? Why did you send Yondu?

1003
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,980
偏偏叫一个罪犯去接我
A criminal, of all people, to come and fetch me?

1004
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,110
我是那么爱你母亲  彼得
I loved your mother, Peter!

1005
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:00,120
我无法忍受去一个再没有她的地球
I couldn't stand to set foot on an Earth where she wasn't living!

1006
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,410
你无法想象那是什么感觉
You can't imagine what that's like!

1007
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,670
我非常清楚那是什么感觉
I know exactly what that feels like!

1008
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,010
我不得不看着她死去
I had to watch her die!

1009
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,820
我存在了千百万年
Over the millions and millions of years of my existence

1010
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,000
犯下了很多错误  彼得
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

1011
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,800
但你不是其中之一
But you're not one of them.

1012
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,310
请给我个机会
Please give me the chance

1013
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,590
做她会希望我做的那种父亲
to be the father she would want me to be.

1014
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:35,460
关于这个星球  和其内部的光
There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet

1015
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,520
我有好多要告诉你
and the light within.

1016
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:40,460
那是你的一部分  彼得
They are a part of you, Peter.

1017
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:42,970
什么意思
What do you mean?

1018
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:45,920
给我你的手  儿子
Give me your hands, son.

1019
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:48,220
来
Here.

1020
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:50,920
这样端住
Hold them like that.

1021
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:54,980
好了
Now,

1022
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,780
闭上眼睛  集中精神
close your eyes and concentrate.

1023
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,690
让思绪进入星球的中心
Take your brain to the center of this planet.

1024
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,100
太好了
Yes!

1025
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,370
就这样
Yes!

1026
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,050
太好了
Yes! Yes!

1027
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:14,570
-太棒了  没事  -怎么回...
- Yes! It's okay. - What was...

1028
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:16,170
放松  集中精神
Just relax. Concentrate.

1029
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:17,890
你可以的  再来
You can do it. Bring it back.

1030
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:19,630
很好
Yes!

1031
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,140
很好  好了  塑形
Yes, yes, now shape it.

1032
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,800
感受那股能量
Feel that energy.

1033
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,550
就这样
Yes.

1034
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,730
你回家了
You're home.

1035
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,560
彼得
Peter...

1036
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:18,180
你是怎么来到这颗奇怪  愚蠢的星球上的
How did you get to this weird, dumb planet?

1037
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:21,230
我还是个幼虫时被伊戈发现
Ego found me in my larva state.

1038
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,520
我在母星是个孤儿
Orphaned on my homeworld.

1039
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:27,810
他亲手养大了我  把我留在了身边
He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.

1040
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:30,090
那么你是个宠物
So you're a pet?

1041
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,450
大概是吧
I suppose.

1042
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,940
人们一般都养可爱的宠物
People usually want cute pets.

1043
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,540
伊戈怎么会养个这么面目可憎的
Why would Ego want such a hideous one?

1044
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,290
我面目可憎吗
I am hideous?

1045
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:43,020
你简直丑得惊心动魄
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

1046
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,140
但那是好事
But that's a good thing.

1047
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,000
如果你长得丑  还有人爱你
When you're ugly, and someone loves you

1048
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,940
你知道那人是爱你这个人
you know they love you for who you are.

1049
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,400
美丽的人永远不知道谁能信任
Beautiful people never know who to trust.

1050
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,700
那我庆幸我很丑
Well, then I'm certainly grateful to be ugly.

1051
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,890
那些池塘  让我想起了有次
Those pools, they remind me of a time...

1052
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:08,340
我带女儿去我母星的遗忘湖
when I took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

1053
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,200
她跟你很像
She was like you.

1054
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,710
难看吗
Disgusting?

1055
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,010
天真无邪
Innocent.

1056
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:49,860
德拉克斯
Drax?

1057
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,610
我得告诉你件事
There's something I must tell you.

1058
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,100
怎么回事
What's going on?

1059
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,420
这位恶心的虫子女士成了我的新朋友
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

1060
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,560
我学到了很多事  比如我是个宠物  而且很丑
I'm learning many things, like I'm a pet and ugly.

1061
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,200
你不丑  德拉克斯
You're not ugly. Drax!

1062
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,360
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

1063
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,370
螳螂
Mantis...

1064
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,630
你能带我们去我们的住处吗
can you show us where we'll be staying?

1065
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,650
这颗星球上怎么没有其他生物
Why are there no other beings on this planet?

1066
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:19,770
这星球就是伊戈
The planet is Ego.

1067
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,900
狗不会邀请跳蚤来他背上住
A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back.

1068
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:24,370
你不是跳蚤
And you're not a flea?

1069
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,320
我是有用的跳蚤
I'm a flea with a purpose.

1070
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,820
我帮他入眠
I help him sleep.

1071
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:33,150
我走出来之前  你正要跟德拉克斯说什么
What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?

1072
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,430
没什么
Nothing.

1073
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,040
你们的住处在这边
Your quarters are this way.

1074
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,420
我们明早把你们送去给克里人
We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.

1075
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:58,560
之后你俩都活不长了
Neither one of you will last much longer after that.

1076
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:01,180
好啊  电击脸
Okay, Taserface.

1077
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:06,020
替我们跟其他人问好  电击脸
Tell the other guys we said "Hi," Taserface!

1078
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:13,710
这颗小植物呢  要我用石头砸碎它吗
What about this little plant? Can I smash it with a rock?

1079
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:15,200
不行  杰夫
No, Gef.

1080
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,910
这么可爱怎么能杀掉
It's too adorable to kill.

1081
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,680
送去裁缝那里
Take it to the tailor.

1082
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,640
别介意  但你的雇员都是混蛋
No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks.

1083
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:31,310
我做了20年的克里人战奴  是斯塔卡解救了我
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years when Stakar freed me.

1084
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,790
他邀我加入了掠夺者
He offered me a place with the Ravagers.

1085
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,020
他说我只需要遵守准则
He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code.

1086
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:42,620
但我年轻
But I was young...

1087
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:47,240
贪心  愚蠢
and greedy, and stupid.

1088
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:50,390
就像你  偷了那些电池
Like you stealing those batteries.

1089
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,060
那更多是德拉克斯干的
That was mostly Drax.

1090
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:56,530
我和斯塔卡  还有其他船长
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

1091
00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:00,480
我们跟你和你的朋友很像
we weren't so different from you and your friends.

1092
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,400
那是我唯一的家庭
The only family I ever had.

1093
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,130
我违反准则后
When I broke the code...

1094
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,990
他们流放了我
they exiled me.

1095
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,180
我活该如此
This is what I deserve.

1096
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,190
等等  矫情女王
Slow down, drama queen.

1097
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,750
你或许是活该  但我不是
You might deserve this, but I don't.

1098
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,150
我们得逃出去
We gotta get outta here.

1099
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:21,290
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

1100
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:23,800
他跟他老爸走了
He went off with his old man.

1101
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:26,380
-伊戈  -对
- Ego? - Yeah.

1102
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,550
今天净是些蠢蛋名字
It's a day for dumbass names.

1103
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:34,330
你笑了  就那么一刻  我有种温暖的感觉
You're smiling. And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

1104
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,060
但你那一口烂牙毁了这感觉
But then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth.

1105
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,590
你是职业混蛋吗
You like a professional asshole or what?

1106
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:40,650
挺专业的反正
Pretty much a pro.

1107
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:43,440
你为什么没像说好的那样把奎尔送去给伊戈
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised?

1108
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,450
他很瘦小
He was skinny.

1109
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:50,060
能钻进我们钻不进的地方  适合偷盗
Could fit into places we couldn't. Good for thievin'.

1110
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:57,970
我知道我们怎么出去了
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

1111
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:01,520
但我需要你的小朋友
But we're gonna need your little friend.

1112
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,620
吉祥物  吉祥物
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

1113
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,120
小家伙好激动  该喝一杯
Little fellow's all worked up! He needs a drink!

1114
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:27,850
看他气成那样多可爱
Look how cute it is when it's all riled up.

1115
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,200
他太有趣了
He's goddang precious!

1116
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,960
小树枝
Hey, twig!

1117
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:46,750
过来
Come here.

1118
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:48,640
过来
Come on.

1119
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,150
天呐  他们把你怎么了
Man... what did they do to you?

1120
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,250
你想帮我们出去吗
You wanna help us get outta here?

1121
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:07,540
我需要你去找样东西  然后拿来给我
There's something I need you to get, and bring back to me.

1122
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:12,120
在船长室  有个原型机机械鳍
In the captain's quarters, there's a prototype fin...

1123
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,160
就是我脑袋上戴的那玩意
the thing I wore on my head.

1124
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:18,650
床铺旁边有个抽屉  就在里面  红色的
There's a drawer next to the bunk. It's in that. It's red.

1125
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:19,650
懂了吗
You got it?

1126
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,370
那是我的内裤
That's my underwears.

1127
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:56,140
嗯  我就觉得
Yeah, I was pretty sure

1128
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,580
他根本就没听懂你说什么
he didn't know what you were talkin' about.

1129
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,600
你得解释得更细致点
You have to explain it more careful.

1130
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,690
是个原型机机械鳍
It's a prototype fin.

1131
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:12,960
那是只奥罗尼  机械鳍  格鲁特
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

1132
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,710
这次你来解释
You explain it this time.

1133
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:16,620
好吧
All right.

1134
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,180
那是沃克的眼睛
That's Vorker's eye.

1135
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,220
他睡觉时会拿下来
He takes it out when he sleeps.

1136
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:23,520
去  再找
Go. Look again.

1137
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,000
把眼睛留下
But leave the eye here.

1138
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:26,720
干吗
Why?

1139
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,500
等他明早醒来
He's gonna wake up tomorrow

1140
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:30,510
会不知道
and he's not gonna know

1141
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,820
他的眼睛去哪了
where his eye is!

1142
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,800
那是张桌子
That's a desk.

1143
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,220
我们说了那玩意才这么大
We told you it was this big.

1144
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:52,000
拜托告诉我你们船上有个冰箱
Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere

1145
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,160
里面全是切下来的人脚趾
with a bunch of severed human toes.

1146
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:58,020
好吧  那我们说好永远不再提这事了
Okay. Then let's just agree to never discuss this.

1147
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,770
你要打开的抽屉  上面有这个标志
The drawer you wanna open has this symbol on it.

1148
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,750
好吗
Okay?

1149
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,100
什么  不
What? No!

1150
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,780
他以为你要他把那个当帽子戴
He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.

1151
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:20,370
我不是那么说的
That's not what I said!

1152
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:22,550
-我是格鲁特  -他很庆幸你不要求他那么做
- I am Groot. - He's relieved you don't want him to.

1153
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:24,350
-我是格鲁特  -他讨厌帽子
- I am Groot. - He hates hats.

1154
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:25,140
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1155
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,550
讨厌任何人戴帽子  不仅是他自己
On anyone, not just himself.

1156
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:27,290
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1157
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:29,110
你还以为谁的脑袋形状很怪
One minute you think someone has a weird-shaped head

1158
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:30,110
结果转眼发现
the next minute it's just because

1159
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:32,030
原来那脑袋上戴了顶帽子
you realize part of that head is the hat.

1160
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,930
所以你才不喜欢帽子
That's why you don't like hats?

1161
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:37,090
这些话非得现在说吗
This is an important conversation right now?

1162
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,360
不是那个
That ain't it.

1163
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:26,590
我并没想哗变的
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

1164
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:31,170
他们杀了我所有的朋友
They killed all my friends.

1165
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:37,760
准备释放第三飞行舱
Get the third quadrant ready for release.

1166
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,830
还有件事
One more thing.

1167
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,710
船上有奎尔那些老歌的备份吗
You got any clones of Quill's old music on the ship?

1168
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:41,520
他拿走了
He's got it!

1169
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,280
勇度拿走了机械鳍
Yondu's got the fin!

1170
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,240
上
Go!

1171
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,200
下面
Down there!

1172
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:27,350
你个疯子
You maniac.

1173
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,040
你会炸掉整艘船的
The whole ship's gonna blow.

1174
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,520
不会是整艘船
Not the whole ship.

1175
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,530
你是谁
Who is this?

1176
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:04,700
我要把勇度的飞船的坐标发你
I am sending you the coordinates for Yondu's ship.

1177
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,390
-释放飞行舱  -是  船长
- Release the quadrant! - Aye, Captain!

1178
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:09,850
我只求一件事
I only ask one thing.

1179
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,340
你们的大祭司
That your High Priestess

1180
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:16,110
要告诉他是谁注定了他的毁灭
tell him the name of the man what sealed his fate.

1181
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:18,770
电击脸
Taserface!

1182
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,550
去哪  船长
Where to, Captain?

1183
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,600
伊戈
Ego.

1184
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,720
不行
No, boy!

1185
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,220
对于哺乳类来说
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body

1186
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:59,920
一下跳跃50次以上对身体有害
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

1187
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,120
我知道
I know that.

1188
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:03,870
我们要跳700次了
We are about to do 700!

1189
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:19,770
那么这一切有一天都可能属于我喽
So I guess this could all be mine someday.

1190
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:23,620
火箭  火箭  你在吗
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

1191
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:31,880
你在干什么  彼得
What are you doing, Peter?

1192
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:35,770
跟我跳舞吧
Dance with me.

1193
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,690
我才不跟你跳舞
I'm not going to dance with you.

1194
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,520
这是山姆·库克的歌
This is Sam Cooke

1195
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:42,640
他可是地球最伟大的歌手之一
one of the greatest Earth singers of all time.

1196
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:14,360
德拉克斯觉得你不是个舞者
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

1197
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:18,340
你要是敢把这件事说出去
If you ever tell anyone about this...

1198
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:19,470
我就杀了你
I will kill you.

1199
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:21,960
我们什么时候处理一下
When are we gonna do something about this

1200
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,930
我们之间心照不宣的情愫啊
unspoken thing between us?

1201
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:26,560
什么心照不宣的情愫
What unspoken thing?

1202
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,930
就是
This...

1203
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,530
像《欢乐酒店》里  萨姆和黛安那样
Cheers, Sam and Diane...

1204
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:35,330
电视剧里相互喜欢的一男一女
a guy and a girl on a TV show who dig each other...

1205
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:37,900
但他们从不说破  否则收视率就要下降了
but never say it because if they do, the ratings would go down...

1206
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:39,050
就这种的
sort of thing.

1207
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:40,770
才没有什么心照不宣的情愫
There's no unspoken thing.

1208
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:44,730
这是22条军规  如果你说了
Well, it's a catch-22, because if you said it,

1209
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:45,690
那就不叫心照不宣了
then it would be spoken

1210
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:48,750
那你就是撒谎了  所以你不说
and you would be a liar. So, by not saying it...

1211
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:52,830
反而是在说实话  也就是承认有
you are telling the truth, and admitting that there is.

1212
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,160
不  我不是那个...
No, that's not what I...

1213
01:12:57,650 --> 01:12:59,670
我们现在应该说的
What we should be discussing right now

1214
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,650
是这地方
is something about this place.

1215
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,480
有点不对劲
It doesn't feel right.

1216
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,490
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

1217
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,010
是你希望我来的
You're the one who wanted me to come here!

1218
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:09,150
那个螳螂女
That girl Mantis

1219
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:10,580
她在怕什么
she's afraid of something.

1220
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:12,980
你为什么要夺走这一切
Why are you trying to take this away from me?

1221
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:14,060
我没有...
I'm not trying...

1222
01:13:14,060 --> 01:13:16,040
他是我父亲  是我的血亲
He's my father. He's blood.

1223
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:17,870
你在地球也有血亲  你可不想回那儿去
You have blood on Earth and you never wanted to return there.

1224
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:19,800
再说一遍  是你逼我来的
Again, you made me come here!

1225
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,200
而且地球  地球是我母亲死在我面前的地方
And Earth, Earth is the place where my mother died in front of me.

1226
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,480
不  是因为那里是真实的  这里只是个幻想
No, it's because that place is real, and this is a fantasy.

1227
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,240
这是真的  我是个半人  记得吗
This is real! I'm only half human, remember?

1228
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,000
我担心的就是那一半
That's the half I'm worried about.

1229
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:31,750
我懂了  你嫉妒
I get it. You're jealous

1230
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,630
因为我是半神  而你喜欢我比较弱的时候
because I'm part-god, and you like when I'm the weak one.

1231
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:37,150
你本就让人难以忍受
You were insufferable to begin with.

1232
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:38,550
我一直联系不上火箭
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

1233
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:40,180
我要出去  看看能不能搜到信号
I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

1234
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:43,180
知道吗  这根本不是《欢乐酒店》
You know what? This is not Cheers after all!

1235
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,820
在这部剧里
This is whatever the show is

1236
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,880
一个人愿意敞开心扉面对新的前景
where one person is willing to open themselves up to new possibility,

1237
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,960
而另一个人却是个混蛋
and the other person is a jerk

1238
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:51,640
不信任任何人
who doesn't trust anybody!

1239
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,550
这是部不存在的剧
It's a show that doesn't exist.

1240
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:55,540
所以它不会有任何收视率
That's why it would get zero ratings!

1241
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:57,670
我不知道《欢乐酒店》是什么
I don't know what Cheers is!

1242
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:01,070
我终于找到我的家人了  你不懂吗
I finally found my family. Don't you understand that?

1243
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:03,610
我以为你已经有家人了
I thought you already had.

1244
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:34,450
该死
Damn it.

1245
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,070
神经病
Psychopath!

1246
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,510
你搞什么
Are you kidding me?

1247
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:48,570
我赢了
I win.

1248
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:50,700
我赢了  我打败了你
I win. I bested you in combat.

1249
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:53,050
不  是我救了你
No. I saved your life.

1250
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:55,160
你留我一命真是太蠢了
Well, you were stupid enough to let me live.

1251
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:55,980
是你没下杀手
You let me live!

1252
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,000
我不需要你总想打赢我
I don't need you always trying to beat me!

1253
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,850
我可没刚刚穿越宇宙
I'm not the one that just flew across the universe

1254
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:00,870
就为了争个输赢
just because I wanted to win.

1255
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:02,590
用不着你告诉我我要什么
Do not tell me what I want.

1256
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:04,380
我不用告诉你你要什么
I don't need to tell you what you want!

1257
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:04,890
明摆着的
It's obvious!

1258
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:08,460
你才是想赢的那个  我只想要个姐姐
You were the one who wanted to win. And I just wanted a sister!

1259
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:17,820
我只有你
You were all I had.

1260
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,400
但你总想赢
But you were the one who needed to win.

1261
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:25,380
灭霸把我的眼睛挖出来
Thanos pulled my eye from my head

1262
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:27,920
把我的大脑取出来
and my brain from my skull

1263
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:31,060
把我的胳膊拽下来
and my arm from my body

1264
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:34,520
都是因为你
because of you.

1265
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:57,350
你没事吧  儿子
You all right, son?

1266
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:03,580
我之前看见你女朋友怒气冲冲地走了
I saw your girl stomp off a little earlier in quite a huff.

1267
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:04,500
是啊
Yeah.

1268
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:08,150
你听这首歌真巧
It's fortuitous you listening to this song.

1269
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:10,370
-你知道  -《布兰迪》
- You know... - Brandy?

1270
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:12,040
镜子组合的
By Looking Glass?

1271
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:15,120
是你妈妈的最爱
A favorite of your mom's.

1272
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,230
是啊
Yeah, it was.

1273
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:19,660
是地球最伟大的音乐作品之一
One of Earth's greatest musical compositions.

1274
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,700
也许就是最伟大的
Perhaps its very greatest.

1275
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:22,770
说得太对了
Yeah, yes!

1276
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:26,700
彼得  你我就是那首歌里的水手
Peter, you and I, we're the sailor in that song.

1277
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:30,230
他在一个夏日出现
He came on a summer's day.

1278
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,230
带来远方的礼物
Bringing gifts from far away.

1279
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:37,300
就像我让你妈妈怀上的那个孩子
Like the child I put in your mother...

1280
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,840
或是你给卡魔拉的自由
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

1281
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:44,980
布兰迪  你是个好姑娘
Brandy, you're a fine girl.

1282
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,510
你肯定会是个好妻子
What a good wife you would be.

1283
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:51,520
我的生活  我的爱
My life, my love.

1284
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,460
我的女人是大海
My lady is the sea.

1285
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:57,130
大海召唤着水手
The sea calls the sailor back.

1286
01:19:57,130 --> 01:20:00,090
他爱那姑娘  但那里不是他的天地
He loves the girl, but that's not his place.

1287
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:04,960
大海召唤他  就像历史召唤伟人
The sea calls upon him as history calls upon great men.

1288
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:09,350
有时我们无法享受凡人的乐趣
And sometimes we are deprived the pleasures of mortals.

1289
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:11,950
你可能不是凡人  但我
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

1290
01:20:11,950 --> 01:20:13,050
不  彼得
No, Peter...

1291
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,670
只要这颗星球内的光不熄
death will remain a stranger to both of us

1292
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:18,050
我们就都不用面对死亡
as long as the light burns within the planet.

1293
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,880
我可以永生不死
I'm immortal?

1294
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:23,160
真的吗
Really?

1295
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,260
对  只要光还在
Yes! As long as the light exists.

1296
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:30,940
我可以用那光建造很酷的东西  就像
And I can use the light to build cool things like

1297
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:32,780
你当初建造这颗星球那样
how you made this whole planet?

1298
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:35,350
你可能要花几百万年时间去练习
It might take you a few million years of practice

1299
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:37,700
才能得心应手  但  没错
before you get really good at it. But, yes!

1300
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,430
什么  这太
What! This is...

1301
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:42,300
准备见识一个八百英尺的吃豆人雕像吧
Well, get ready for an 800-foot statue of Pac-Man

1302
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:44,130
旁边还有骷髅王[动画形象]和希瑟·拉克里尔[女星]with Skeletor and Heather Locklear.

1303
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:44,830
你想干什么都行
You can do anything you want.

1304
01:20:44,830 --> 01:20:46,980
我要做一些奇怪的东西
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

1305
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:50,230
但是  彼得  这是巨大的责任
But you know, Peter, it is a tremendous responsibility.

1306
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:52,950
只有我们能重塑宇宙
Only we can remake the universe.

1307
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:55,920
只有我们能牵着宇宙的缰绳
Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos

1308
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,060
领导它走向正确的方向
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1309
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:00,520
怎么做
How?

1310
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:12,130
跟我来
Come with me.

1311
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:24,450
德拉克斯  德拉克斯
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1312
01:21:24,450 --> 01:21:26,300
德拉克斯  我们得谈谈
Drax! We need to talk.

1313
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:29,550
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1314
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:32,590
但我喜欢稍微有点肉的女人
But I like a woman with some meat on her bones.

1315
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:33,640
什么
What?

1316
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:35,180
我说我觉得你恶心
I tried to let you down easily

1317
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,230
就是不想让你太伤心
by telling you I found you disgusting.

1318
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:38,840
不  我不是想...
No, that's not what I...

1319
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,400
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1320
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:46,650
我在想象跟你有肌肤之亲
I'm imagining being with you physically.

1321
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:48,290
德拉克斯  我不是想
Drax... That's not...

1322
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:49,860
我对你不是那种喜欢
I don't like you like that.

1323
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,470
我都不喜欢你这个物种
I don't even like the type of thing you are.

1324
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:54,650
没必要人身攻击
There's no need to get personal.

1325
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:57,800
听着  伊戈得到了他想要的
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.

1326
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,220
我应该早点告诉你的
I should have told you earlier.

1327
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:00,600
我真傻
I'm stupid.

1328
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:02,720
你们有危险了
You are in danger.

1329
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:09,960
那是什么
What is that?

1330
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:16,910
你得重新调整你看待生命的方式
Now, you need to readjust the way you process life.

1331
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:19,940
我们身边的一切  包括那个姑娘
Everything around us, including the girl...

1332
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:23,410
一切都是暂时的
Everything is temporary.

1333
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,240
我们才是永恒
We are forever.

1334
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:28,040
永恒不会无聊吗
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1335
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:30,170
如果你有目标就不会  彼得
Not if you have a purpose, Peter,

1336
01:22:30,170 --> 01:22:32,530
你来这儿就是为了那个目标
which is why you're here.

1337
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:35,240
我告诉过你  很多年前
I told you how all those years ago

1338
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:39,260
我有一股不灭的冲动  想找到生命
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

1339
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,750
但我没告诉你的是
But what I did not tell you was how,

1340
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:43,550
当我终于找到它的时候
when I finally did find it...

1341
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:45,750
它是那么的
it was all so...

1342
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,260
令人失望
disappointing.

1343
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:53,030
那时我才
And that is when I came...

1344
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,860
深深地顿悟了
to a profound realization.

1345
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:03,230
我内心寻找其他生命的渴望
My innate desire to seek out other life

1346
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:07,960
不是为了让我能游走于那生命之间
was not so that I could walk among that life.

1347
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,020
彼得
Peter...

1348
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:15,340
我找到了意义
I have found meaning.

1349
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,470
我看见了
I see it.

1350
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:40,630
永恒
Eternity!

1351
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:42,640
天啊
Oh, my God.

1352
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,230
我们得离开这颗星球
We need to get off this planet.

1353
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,060
天啊
Oh, man.

1354
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:13,010
总之  我被粗鲁地打断之前我正在说...
Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted...

1355
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:16,220
那时  我是个联邦快递的快递员
At that time, I was a Federal Express man.

1356
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:29,240
你干什么呢  小子
What the hell you doing, boy?

1357
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:31,080
从你说到他时的样子我看得出
I could tell by how you talked about him

1358
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:32,790
这个伊戈不是好人
this Ego is bad news.

1359
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:34,650
我们得来救奎尔
We're here to save Quill.

1360
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:36,060
为了什么
For what?

1361
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:38,070
荣誉吗
For honor?

1362
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,040
爱吗
For love?

1363
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,570
不  我才不在乎那些
No. I don't care about those things.

1364
01:24:41,570 --> 01:24:44,500
我想救奎尔  好证明我比他强
I wanna save Quill so I can prove I'm better than him!

1365
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:47,650
我能拿这事压他一辈子
I can lord this over him forever.

1366
01:24:49,210 --> 01:24:50,850
你笑我做什么
What are you laughing at me for?

1367
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:56,030
你可以骗自己和其他所有人  但你骗不了我
You can fool yourself and everyone else, but you can't fool me.

1368
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:57,820
我了解你
I know who you are.

1369
01:24:57,830 --> 01:25:00,260
你才不了解我呢  废物
You don't know anything about me, loser.

1370
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,600
我了解你的一切
I know everything about you.

1371
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,580
我知道你假装是最坏最狠的人
I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest,

1372
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,440
但你其实最害怕
but, actually, you're the most scared of all.

1373
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:07,940
闭嘴
Shut up!

1374
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,640
我知道你偷你用不着的电池
I know you steal batteries you don't need

1375
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:13,050
你推开每一个愿意忍受你的人
and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you

1376
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:14,810
因为哪怕一点点爱
because just a little bit of love

1377
01:25:14,820 --> 01:25:18,530
也会提醒你  你内心的空虚多大多深
reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.

1378
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:19,470
我叫你闭嘴了
I said shut up!

1379
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:21,450
我知道那些制造了你的科学家
I know them scientists what made you,

1380
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,460
根本没在乎过你
never gave a rat's ass about you.

1381
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,320
我说真的  哥们
I'm serious, dude!

1382
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,780
就像我自己的父母  他们把我
Just like my own damn parents who sold me

1383
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:30,230
他们的亲生儿子  卖去做奴隶
their own little baby, into slavery.

1384
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:32,760
我知道你是什么人  小子
I know who you are, boy.

1385
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,660
因为你是我
Because you're me.

1386
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:43,330
我们是一对儿什么样的人啊
What kind of a pair are we?

1387
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:47,670
大概是一对儿要去对付一颗星球的人吧
The kind that's about to go fight a planet, I reckon.

1388
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:50,270
好啊  好嘞  很好
All right, okay! Good.

1389
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:51,340
等等
Wait.

1390
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:52,580
对付什么
Fight a what?

1391
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,180
你们是什么人
Who are you people?

1392
01:25:58,180 --> 01:25:58,930
这地方是什么
What is this place?

1393
01:25:58,930 --> 01:26:00,500
卡魔拉  放了她
Gamora, let her go!

1394
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:03,060
洞里的尸体  他们是谁
The bodies in the caverns... Who are they?

1395
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:05,140
你在害怕
You are scared.

1396
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:11,540
我称之为扩张
I call it the Expansion.

1397
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,280
这是我的目标
It is my purpose

1398
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,400
现在
and now

1399
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:19,590
它也是你的目标了
it is yours as well.

1400
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:21,960
好美啊
It's beautiful.

1401
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,360
数千年来
Over thousands of years,

1402
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,000
我将数千个我的延伸根植在了
I implanted thousands of extensions of myself

1403
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,530
数千个世界上
on thousands of worlds.

1404
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:35,780
我得实现生命唯一真正的目标
I need to fulfill life's one true purpose...

1405
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:37,940
生长  传播
To grow and spread

1406
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:41,160
覆盖一切存在
covering all that exists

1407
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:45,430
直到一切都
until everything is...

1408
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:47,580
变成我
Me!

1409
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:49,840
她对我做了什么
What did she do to me?

1410
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:52,410
她已经把一切都告诉我了
She already told me everything.

1411
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:54,970
我只有一个问题
I only had one problem.

1412
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:57,440
一个天神
A single Celestial

1413
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,270
是没有足够能量完成这样的伟业的
doesn't have enough power for such an enterprise.

1414
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:03,250
但两个天神
But two Celestials...

1415
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:06,640
那或许就可以了
Well, now, that just might do.

1416
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:10,650
那些尸体
The bodies...

1417
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:12,970
都是他的孩子
are his children.

1418
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,130
我所做的一切中
Out of all my labors

1419
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,250
我最喜欢的
the most beguiling

1420
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:21,550
就是尝试将我的DNA嫁接到其他物种上
was attempting to graft my DNA with that of another species.

1421
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:24,130
我原本希望这样的配对
I hoped the result of such a coupling

1422
01:27:24,130 --> 01:27:26,710
足以为扩张提供能量
would be enough to power the Expansion.

1423
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:30,410
我让勇度把一些后代送来给我
I had Yondu deliver some of them to me.

1424
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:32,040
这有违掠夺者的准则
It broke the Ravager code,

1425
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,300
但我慷慨地赔偿了他
but I compensated him generously and

1426
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:37,830
而且为安抚他的良心  我说我绝不会伤害他们
to ease his conscience, I said I'd never hurt them.

1427
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,510
这倒不假  他们都毫无感觉
I mean, that was true. They never felt a thing.

1428
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:43,460
但他们一个个都让我失望了
But one after the other, they failed me.

1429
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:47,260
没有一个携带了天神基因
Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.

1430
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:49,290
直到你  彼得
Until you, Peter.

1431
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:52,640
我所有的后裔里
Out of all my spawn,

1432
01:27:53,230 --> 01:27:57,410
只有你继承了与光的联系
only you carried the connection to the light.

1433
01:27:57,610 --> 01:28:00,500
我们得马上找到彼得  离开这个破星球
We need to find Peter now, and get off this damn planet.

1434
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:03,180
伊戈现在肯定已经拉拢了他
Ego will have won him to his side by now.

1435
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:04,880
-他有办法...  -那我们直接走吧
- He has a way of... - Then we just go.

1436
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:05,860
不行
No!

1437
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:06,980
他是我们的朋友
He's our friend.

1438
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,420
你们就成天冲彼此大吼
All any of you do is yell at each other.

1439
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:10,600
你们才不是朋友
You are not friends.

1440
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:11,670
你是对的
You're right.

1441
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:13,920
我们是家人
We're family.

1442
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,010
我们不丢下任何人
We leave no one behind.

1443
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:21,740
或许除了你
Except maybe you.

1444
01:28:22,490 --> 01:28:23,920
天呐
Oh, my God.

1445
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,400
我存在以来首次
For the first time in my existence,

1446
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:29,760
真正不再孤单了
I am truly not alone!

1447
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:36,550
怎么了  儿子
What is it, son?

1448
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:41,130
我的朋友们
My friends.

1449
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:46,480
你瞧  这就是你人性的一面  彼得
You see, that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1450
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:47,970
是啊
Yes.

1451
01:28:47,970 --> 01:28:50,860
我们超越了那些东西
We are beyond such things.

1452
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:51,890
是啊
Yes.

1453
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:56,140
-好了  -但我母亲
- Now... - But my mother...

1454
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,920
你说你爱我母亲的
You said you loved my mother.

1455
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,670
我是爱她
And that I did.

1456
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,540
我的水百合
My river lily who knew

1457
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:08,940
她会唱收音机里播放的每一首歌
all the words to every song that came over the radio.

1458
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:13,370
我三次回到地球看她
I returned to Earth to see her three times.

1459
01:29:13,370 --> 01:29:15,750
我知道  如果我再第四次回去
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

1460
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,550
我就再不会走了
I'd never leave.

1461
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:20,060
扩张
The Expansion...

1462
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:24,280
我存在的目的  就完了
the reason for my very existence, would be over.

1463
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:25,850
所以我做了我必须做的
So, I did what I had to do.

1464
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:27,760
但是
But

1465
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:32,420
让她患上脑瘤简直伤透了我的心
it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head.

1466
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:38,060
什么
What?

1467
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:39,130
好吧
Now, all right...

1468
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:42,180
我知道这听上去很不好
I know that sounds bad.

1469
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:53,080
你
Who

1470
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:57,170
以为你是谁啊
in the hell do you think you are?

1471
01:29:57,170 --> 01:29:59,090
你杀了我母亲
You killed my mother!

1472
01:29:59,090 --> 01:30:00,380
我
I tried...

1473
01:30:00,380 --> 01:30:02,060
那么努力
so hard...

1474
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:06,010
找到最适合你的形态
to find the form that best suited you...

1475
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:09,200
这就是你的感谢吗
and this is the thanks I get?

1476
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:12,660
你真得长大了
You really need to grow up.

1477
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:18,870
我本想跟你一起做的
I wanted to do this together...

1478
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:21,070
但看来你只能
but I suppose you'll have to learn

1479
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:24,500
做个一千年的电池  慢慢长进了
by spending the next thousand years as a battery!

1480
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,490
可算  火箭
Finally! Rocket?

1481
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:31,190
把发射器带在身边  我好找你
Keep that transmitter nearby, so I can find you.

1482
01:30:31,190 --> 01:30:33,250
我们在一件旧施工设备里
We're in an old piece of construction equipment

1483
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:36,380
勇度曾用它来切开艾斯克维拉银行
Yondu once used to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.

1484
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:37,370
伊戈是个疯子
Ego's unhinged.

1485
01:30:37,370 --> 01:30:38,790
我知道  准备好
I know. Get ready.

1486
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:40,200
放  克拉林
Drop her, Kraglin.

1487
01:30:58,650 --> 01:30:59,890
不
No.

1488
01:31:11,110 --> 01:31:14,130
我的生命  我的爱
My life, my love.

1489
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:16,560
我的女人是大海
My lady is the sea

1490
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:19,420
彼得
Peter...

1491
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:22,710
这就是那海
this is the sea.

1492
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:07,620
你好啊  混蛋
Hey, there, jackass!

1493
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:19,240
那是什么玩意
What is that thing?

1494
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:29,050
闪开  小笨格鲁特
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

1495
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:35,990
我就说有点不对劲
I told you something didn't feel right.

1496
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:38,650
"我早说过"  我现在正需要听这种话
"I told you so." Just what I need to hear right now.

1497
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:40,230
我不是回来了吗
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1498
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:42,420
因为我们有心照不宣的情愫
Because there's an unspoken thing.

1499
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:44,640
才没有什么心照不宣的情愫
There is no unspoken thing.

1500
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,060
你干什么呢  你差点害死我们
What are you doing? You could've killed us all!

1501
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:48,850
"谢谢  火箭"
"Thank you, Rocket"?

1502
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:50,230
我们都控制局面了
We had it under control.

1503
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:53,920
我们没有  那只是他真身的延伸
We did not. That is only an extension of his true self.

1504
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:55,200
他很快就会回来的
He will be back soon.

1505
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,270
蓝妹妹怎么在这儿
What's Smurfette doing here?

1506
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:58,360
我只想搭车回家
Whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home.

1507
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:00,000
她还想杀我
She tried to murder me!

1508
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
我救了你  你个蠢狐狸
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1509
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,470
他不是狐狸
He's not a fox.

1510
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:05,550
-我是格鲁特  -我也不是浣兔
- I am Groot. - I'm not a raboon, either.

1511
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:06,830
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1512
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:08,600
是"浣熊"  算了
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1513
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:13,380
怎么杀一个天神啊
How do we kill a Celestial?

1514
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:14,790
他有个核
There's a center to him.

1515
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,170
他的大脑还是灵魂什么的
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...

1516
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:18,860
有个保护壳
Some sort of protective shell.

1517
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:21,440
在地表下的洞穴里
It's in the caverns below the surface.

1518
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:24,710
勇度
Yondu?

1519
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:35,380
推进器失去动力了
Thrusters are out.

1520
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:37,280
看来我该庆幸我长得瘦
Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.

1521
01:33:37,290 --> 01:33:39,540
否则你就会把我交给这个疯子了
Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.

1522
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:42,080
你还以为那是我留下了你的原因吗  白痴
You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?

1523
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:44,140
是你这么跟我说的  你个老笨蛋
That's what you told me, you old doofus.

1524
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:46,400
我搞明白了其他孩子的下场后
Once I figured out what happened to them other kids

1525
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,120
我当然不能把你交出去
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

1526
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:50,080
你说你要吃了我
You said you were gonna eat me.

1527
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,850
那是玩笑话
That was being funny!

1528
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:53,450
我可没想笑
Not to me!

1529
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:55,030
你们真有毛病
You people have issues.

1530
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:57,150
我当然有毛病
Of course I have issues.

1531
01:33:57,550 --> 01:34:00,060
那可是我老爸
That's my freakin' father!

1532
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:02,140
推进器恢复了
Thrusters are back up.

1533
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:18,000
-我们该向上飞  -不行
- We should be going up! - We can't!

1534
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
伊戈想毁掉我们所知的宇宙
Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it.

1535
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,170
我们得杀了他
We have to kill him.

1536
01:34:22,170 --> 01:34:23,090
火箭
Rocket!

1537
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:23,970
好嘞
Got it!

1538
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:40,050
那我们又要拯救银河系了
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1539
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:41,130
大概是吧
I guess.

1540
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:42,300
太棒了
Awesome!

1541
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,620
如果我们救了两次银河系
We're really gonna be able to jack up our prices

1542
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:48,550
就能坐地起价了
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1543
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:51,270
我真不敢相信你居然想到了这个
I seriously can't believe that's where your mind goes.

1544
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:54,130
就是想想嘛  哥们  我们不是朋友嘛
It was just a random thought, man. I thought we were friends.

1545
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:56,630
我当然在乎那些星球啊  建筑啊
Of course, I care about the planets, and the buildings

1546
01:34:56,630 --> 01:34:58,750
和各个星球上的动物啊
and all the animals on the planets.

1547
01:34:58,750 --> 01:35:00,050
还有人呢
And the people.

1548
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:05,650
那个坏脾气狗狗好可爱  他让我想死
The crabby puppy is so cute. He makes me wanna die!

1549
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:44,660
飞行员
Pilots...

1550
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:46,420
释放先遣队
release envoy units.

1551
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:51,990
我们的传感器感应到电池在星球地表下
Our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet.

1552
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:55,190
下潜
Dive!

1553
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:13,950
船长
Captain?

1554
01:36:14,430 --> 01:36:15,240
船长
Captain?

1555
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:22,980
伊戈为什么找你来
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

1556
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:25,280
他需要我跟光的基因联系
He needs my genetic connection to the light

1557
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,070
来帮他毁灭宇宙
to help destroy the universe.

1558
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:29,280
他还想教我控制能量
He tried to teach me how to control the power.

1559
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:30,590
你能控制吗
So, could you?

1560
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:31,830
稍稍能吧
A little.

1561
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:33,330
我做了个能量球
I made a ball.

1562
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:34,730
球
A ball?

1563
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:36,700
我已经拼命去想了
I thought as hard as I could.

1564
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:38,310
我只能弄出来个那个
It was all that I could come up with.

1565
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:39,390
你"想"
You "thought"?

1566
01:36:39,700 --> 01:36:41,460
你以为我控制这支箭飞的时候
You think when I make this arrow fly

1567
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:42,930
是用的脑袋吗
I use my head?

1568
01:37:05,860 --> 01:37:06,620
那儿
There.

1569
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:08,330
那就是伊戈的核
That's Ego's core.

1570
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,690
外壳很厚  火箭
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1571
01:37:12,730 --> 01:37:14,080
交给我吧
I got it covered.

1572
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:21,820
我们必须快点
We must hurry.

1573
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:24,440
伊戈很快就会找到我们
It will not take Ego long to find us.

1574
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,730
稳住
Keep it steady.

1575
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:38,400
钻透到核  然后杀死他
We drill into the center, we kill him!

1576
01:37:45,330 --> 01:37:46,250
船长
Captain?

1577
01:37:46,300 --> 01:37:47,620
怎么了  克拉林
What is it, Kraglin?

1578
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,020
还记得阿耶莎那妞儿吗
Remember that Ayesha chick?

1579
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:51,120
记得  怎么了
Yeah, why?

1580
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:52,890
该死
Oh, hell!

1581
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:15,990
你为什么不开激光炮
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1582
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:17,900
他们炸掉了发电机
They blew out the generator.

1583
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:20,250
我记得我带了一个小引爆器
I think I packed a small detonator.

1584
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:22,470
有引爆器没炸药也没用
A detonator is worthless without explosives.

1585
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:24,200
我们有这些
Well, we got these.

1586
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:26,830
这玩意的破坏性能杀死伊戈吗
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1587
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:29,010
如果能的话  会造成他整个
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction

1588
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:30,870
神经系统的连锁反应
throughout his entire nervous system.

1589
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:31,660
意思是
Meaning what?

1590
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:33,680
整颗星球都会爆炸
The entire planet will explode.

1591
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,610
我们得快点逃出去
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1592
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,090
我装了个定时器
I rigged a timer.

1593
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:38,710
走
Go!

1594
01:38:52,970 --> 01:38:54,690
他要来了
He's coming.

1595
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:58,150
你不是说你能让他睡着吗
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?

1596
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:01,130
在他想睡的时候  他太强大了
When he wants. He's too powerful.

1597
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:02,400
我做不到
I can't!

1598
01:39:02,930 --> 01:39:04,780
你不用相信自己
You don't have to believe in yourself

1599
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,440
因为我相信你
because I believe in you.

1600
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:21,110
睡吧
Sleep!

1601
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:29,890
我没想到她能做到
I never thought she'd be able to do it

1602
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:32,310
毕竟她一副很瘦弱的样子
with as weak and skinny as she appears to be.

1603
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:35,750
我不知道我能拖住他多久
I don't know how long I can hold him.

1604
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:40,880
金属太厚了
The metal's too thick.

1605
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,000
要让炸弹达到目的
For the bomb to work,

1606
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,910
我们得把它放在伊戈的核上
we'd actually need to place it on Ego's core.

1607
01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:47,860
我们的大屁股钻不进这些小洞里
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit through those tiny holes.

1608
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:49,120
那么
Well...

1609
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:53,190
这主意糟透了
That's a terrible idea.

1610
01:39:53,230 --> 01:39:55,810
我们就剩这一个主意了
Which is the only kind of idea we have left.

1611
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,200
难以置信
Unbelievable.

1612
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:01,250
"火箭  做这个  火箭  做那个"
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."

1613
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:03,470
今天真够受的
What a day.

1614
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:14,770
好了  首先你打开这个开关  再打开这个
All right, first you flick this switch, then this switch.

1615
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:16,300
这样就启动了
That activates it.

1616
01:40:16,300 --> 01:40:18,570
接着你按下这个按钮
Then you push this button

1617
01:40:18,580 --> 01:40:21,330
让你有五分钟时间逃跑
which will give you five minutes to get out of there.

1618
01:40:21,710 --> 01:40:23,350
不管你做什么
Now, whatever you do

1619
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:25,930
千万别按这个按钮
don't push this button

1620
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:28,160
因为那样会立即引爆炸弹
because that will set off the bomb immediately

1621
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,710
我们就都没命了
and we'll all be dead.

1622
01:40:29,710 --> 01:40:32,330
重复一遍我刚才说的
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1623
01:40:32,660 --> 01:40:34,080
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1624
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:36,590
-我是格鲁特  -对了
- I am Groot. - That's right.

1625
01:40:36,590 --> 01:40:38,190
-我是格鲁特  -不
- I am Groot. - No!

1626
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:40,520
不对  这个按钮会杀死所有人
No, that's the button that will kill everyone!

1627
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:41,980
再来
Try again.

1628
01:40:44,740 --> 01:40:45,860
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1629
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:47,920
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1630
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:49,860
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1631
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:51,820
不  你刚才就是这么错的
No! That's exactly what you just said!

1632
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:53,670
这怎么可能
How is that even possible?

1633
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,710
你应该按哪个按钮
Which button is the button you're supposed to push?

1634
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:56,800
指一下
Point to it.

1635
01:40:57,660 --> 01:40:58,830
不对
No!

1636
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:00,470
你让他紧张了
You're making him nervous!

1637
01:41:00,470 --> 01:41:02,370
闭嘴  给我拿点胶带来
Shut up and get me some tape!

1638
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:04,020
外面有人有胶带吗
Does anybody have any tape out there?

1639
01:41:04,020 --> 01:41:05,790
我要把死亡按钮贴上胶带
I wanna put some tape over the death button.

1640
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,120
我没胶带  我去问问
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

1641
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:11,390
勇度  你有...
Yo, Yondu... do you have...

1642
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,930
你有胶带吗
Do you have any tape?

1643
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,800
卡魔拉  你有胶带吗
Gamora? Do you have any tape?

1644
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:20,330
胶带
Tape!

1645
01:41:20,810 --> 01:41:21,930
算了
Never mind.

1646
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:26,590
德拉克斯  你有胶带吗
Drax, do you have any tape?

1647
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:29,150
对  透明胶也行
Yes, scotch tape would work.

1648
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:31,740
既然你没有  为什么还要问我
Then why did you ask me if scotch tape would work,

1649
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:33,010
透明胶行不行
if you don't have any?

1650
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,520
没人有胶带
Nobody has any tape!

1651
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,630
谁都没有胶带吗
Not a single person has tape?

1652
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:38,230
没有
Nope!

1653
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:39,940
你问过星云了吗
Did you ask Nebula?

1654
01:41:40,710 --> 01:41:41,400
问过了
Yes!

1655
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:42,600
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1656
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:43,950
我问勇度的时候
I asked Yondu...

1657
01:41:43,950 --> 01:41:46,670
-她就坐在他旁边  -我就知道你撒谎
- and she was sitting next to him. - I knew you were lying!

1658
01:41:46,670 --> 01:41:49,580
你包里装着价值连城的电池还有一枚原子弹
You have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag.

1659
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:51,340
要说谁会带胶带  就是你了
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

1660
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:55,030
我就想说这个  什么事都得我做
That's exactly my point! I have to do everything!

1661
01:41:55,030 --> 01:41:57,390
你浪费了多少时间
You are wasting a lot of time here!

1662
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:05,510
我们都要死了
We're all gonna die.

1663
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:09,890
后推进器又坏了
Rear thrusters are out again!

1664
01:42:09,890 --> 01:42:12,460
没那个发电机我们死定了
We're done for without that generator!

1665
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:27,360
银河护卫队
Guardians...

1666
01:42:28,110 --> 01:42:30,220
也许这对你们会是个安慰
perhaps it will provide you solace

1667
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:32,840
你们的死  不会毫无意义
that your deaths are not without purpose.

1668
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:34,700
而是会警告那些
They will serve as a warning

1669
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:37,180
想要背叛我们的人
to all of those tempted with betraying us.

1670
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:40,670
别想耍索维林族
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1671
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:45,740
会很疼的
This is gonna hurt.

1672
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:47,300
光说不练
Promises, promises.

1673
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:10,940
不
No!

1674
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:15,530
不不不
No! No! No!

1675
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:20,380
要爆炸了
We're gonna blow!

1676
01:43:25,690 --> 01:43:28,030
彼得  不
Peter! No!

1677
01:43:47,530 --> 01:43:48,340
怎么了
What?

1678
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:50,700
你活像玛丽·波平斯
You look like Mary Poppins.

1679
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:52,290
他酷吗
Is he cool?

1680
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:55,490
当然  他很酷
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1681
01:43:56,550 --> 01:43:58,370
我是玛丽·波平斯哦
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1682
01:44:25,870 --> 01:44:27,540
螳螂  小心
Mantis, look out!

1683
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,300
她只是昏过去了
She's just unconscious.

1684
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:59,010
炸弹还有多久炸
How long until the bomb goes off?

1685
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:01,760
万一万一格鲁特没把我们都炸死
In the unlikely event that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1686
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:03,290
那还有六分钟
about six minutes.

1687
01:45:07,930 --> 01:45:10,690
克拉林  我们需要飞行舱来带我们撤离
Kraglin, we need the quadrant for an extraction.

1688
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:11,470
倒计时5分钟
T-minus five minutes.

1689
01:45:11,470 --> 01:45:12,540
是  船长
Aye, Captain.

1690
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:19,480
克拉林到时  上面得有人接应
Somebody's gotta be up top when Kraglin arrives.

1691
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,790
德拉克斯  带螳螂走
Drax, take Mantis.

1692
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:25,730
我的乳头
My nipples!

1693
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:34,810
卡魔拉
Gamora!

1694
01:45:38,870 --> 01:45:40,060
彼得
Peter!

1695
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:07,500
别想多了
Get over it.

1696
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:11,500
得了  彼得  我知道你并不想这样
Come now, Peter. I know this isn't what you want.

1697
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:18,450
我让你做出这样的选择  还算什么父亲啊
What kind of father would I be to let you make this choice?

1698
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:49,060
帅气
Yeah!

1699
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:54,010
很快  彼得  我们就将成为一切
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

1700
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:57,860
别再惹我生气了
So stop pissing me off!

1701
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,680
我们得上去撤离点
We have to get up to the extraction point!

1702
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:28,140
冲
Go!

1703
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:29,170
我说过
I told you...

1704
01:49:29,410 --> 01:49:32,830
我不想一个人做
I don't want to do this alone.

1705
01:49:36,490 --> 01:49:38,140
你不能拒绝
You cannot deny

1706
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:42,180
宇宙赋予你的人生目的
the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you.

1707
01:49:51,050 --> 01:49:53,400
大家不要靠近
Everyone, I need you to stay back!

1708
01:49:53,460 --> 01:49:54,660
那是什么
What is that?

1709
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:12,290
不非得如此的  彼得
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.

1710
01:50:13,790 --> 01:50:16,840
你为什么要毁掉我们的机会
Why are you destroying our chance?

1711
01:50:19,930 --> 01:50:22,880
别再否认自己的身份了
Stop pretending you aren't what you are.

1712
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:26,570
你是上亿
One in billions.

1713
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:29,640
上兆  甚至更多中的唯一
Trillions. Even more.

1714
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:36,590
生命怎么可能有更伟大的意义
What greater meaning can life possibly have to offer?

1715
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:43,110
我不是用脑袋控制箭的  孩子
I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!

1716
01:50:43,670 --> 01:50:45,720
我是用心
I use my heart...

1717
01:51:20,690 --> 01:51:24,490
你不该杀了我妈妈  还捏碎我的随身听
You shouldn't have killed my mom, and squished my Walkman.

1718
01:52:04,860 --> 01:52:07,880
格鲁特  如果你听得到  快点
Groot? If you can hear me, hurry up!

1719
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:11,130
我不确定奎尔还能分散他注意力多久
I'm not sure how long Quill can keep him distracted!

1720
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:12,650
格鲁特  快点
Groot, hurry!

1721
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:11,140
勇度  我们要炸了
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1722
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:12,550
上船
Get to the ship!

1723
01:53:12,730 --> 01:53:14,020
不能丢下奎尔
Not without Quill!

1724
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:16,250
你还得照顾小树枝
You need to take care of the twig!

1725
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:19,140
不能丢下你
Not without you!

1726
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:23,520
我这辈子都没做过几件好事  耗子
I ain't done nothin' right my whole damn life, rat.

1727
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:28,770
让我做这件吧
You need to give me this.

1728
01:53:39,490 --> 01:53:41,680
一套太空服和一个飞行装置
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1729
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:43,690
我一样只有一个
I only have one of each.

1730
01:53:56,590 --> 01:53:58,510
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1731
01:53:59,010 --> 01:54:00,110
他说什么
What's that?

1732
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:06,110
他说  "欢迎加入他娘的银河护卫队"
He says, "Welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy."

1733
01:54:06,580 --> 01:54:08,690
而且他用的词不是"他娘的"
Only he didn't use "Frickin'."

1734
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:16,290
再见  小树枝
Bye, twig.

1735
01:54:18,190 --> 01:54:21,150
我们回头得好好谈谈你说粗话的问题
We're gonna need to have a real discussion about your language.

1736
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:17,470
彼得呢
Where's Peter?

1737
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:19,710
火箭  他在哪
Rocket, where is he?

1738
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:21,900
火箭
Rocket.

1739
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:23,840
火箭  看着我  他在哪
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

1740
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:32,590
不  我不能丢下他
No. I'm not leaving without him.

1741
01:55:39,510 --> 01:55:40,580
对不起
I'm sorry.

1742
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:43,710
我今天只能承受失去一个朋友
I can only afford to lose one friend today.

1743
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:46,240
克拉林  走
Kraglin, go!

1744
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:47,160
等等
Wait...

1745
01:55:48,270 --> 01:55:49,310
奎尔回来了吗
Is Quill back?

1746
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:53,400
火箭  奎尔呢
Rocket, where's Quill?

1747
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:57,750
火箭  奎尔呢
Rocket, where's Quill?

1748
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,230
火箭
Rocket!

1749
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:03,380
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

1750
01:56:04,840 --> 01:56:06,400
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

1751
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:16,520
不  我们得阻止它
No, we need to stop it.

1752
01:56:16,530 --> 01:56:18,010
我们得阻止它
We need to stop it.

1753
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:23,180
不  停下
No. Stop.

1754
01:56:23,900 --> 01:56:25,790
停下  听着  听我说
Stop. Listen. Listen to me!

1755
01:56:25,990 --> 01:56:27,530
你是个神
You are a god.

1756
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:29,890
如果你杀了我
If you kill me...

1757
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:32,790
你就跟其他人一样了
you'll be just like everybody else.

1758
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:35,890
那有什么不好
What's so wrong with that?

1759
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,240
不
No!

1760
01:57:27,490 --> 01:57:31,330
他或许是你生父  孩子  但他可不是你爸爸
He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn't your daddy.

1761
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:37,850
真抱歉我一件事都没做对
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

1762
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:40,850
你是我的孩子我太走运了
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1763
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:45,880
什么
What?

1764
01:57:58,280 --> 01:57:59,610
勇度  你干什么
Yondu, what are you doing?

1765
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:00,700
不行
You can't.

1766
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:03,470
勇度
Yondu!

1767
01:58:08,710 --> 01:58:09,550
不
No!

1768
01:58:10,290 --> 01:58:11,070
不
No!

1769
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:15,910
不
No!

1770
01:58:19,150 --> 01:58:21,810
不不
No! No!

1771
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,540
不要
No!

1772
01:59:19,060 --> 01:59:20,650
我告诉卡魔拉
I told Gamora

1773
01:59:20,650 --> 01:59:21,760
我小时候
how when I was a kid

1774
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,830
会假装大卫·霍索夫是我爸爸
I used to pretend David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1775
01:59:26,850 --> 01:59:29,890
他是地球的一个歌手演员  很出名
He's a singer and actor from Earth, really famous guy.

1776
01:59:31,770 --> 01:59:33,310
刚刚  我突然想到
Earlier, it struck me...

1777
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:38,860
勇度没有会说话的车  但他有会飞的箭
Yondu didn't have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow.

1778
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:41,620
他没有天使般美丽的歌喉
He didn't have the beautiful voice of an angel

1779
01:59:41,630 --> 01:59:43,730
但他的哨声有如天籁
but he did have the whistle of one.

1780
01:59:44,270 --> 01:59:47,870
勇度和大卫·霍索夫都会经历牛逼的冒险
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff went on kick-ass adventures

1781
01:59:47,870 --> 01:59:49,590
勾搭性感的女人
and hooked up with hot women

1782
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:52,220
还打机器人
and fought robots.

1783
01:59:55,170 --> 01:59:58,580
看来大卫·霍索夫终究成为了我爸爸
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of end up being my dad after all.

1784
01:59:59,700 --> 02:00:01,250
但其实那是你  勇度
Only it was you, Yondu.

1785
02:00:07,170 --> 02:00:08,560
我有个很酷的爸爸
I had a pretty cool dad.

1786
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:13,750
我想说的是
What I'm trying to say here is...

1787
02:00:15,640 --> 02:00:20,370
有时候你寻找了一生的东西
sometimes that thing you're searching for your whole life

1788
02:00:22,770 --> 02:00:24,700
其实一直在你身边
it's right there by your side all along.

1789
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:26,610
你却不自知
You don't even know it.

1790
02:00:39,120 --> 02:00:40,450
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1791
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:43,590
他是喊你小树枝
He did call you twig.

1792
02:00:46,150 --> 02:00:47,170
星云
Nebula...

1793
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:54,060
我跟你一样只是个孩子
I was a child like you.

1794
02:00:55,390 --> 02:00:59,240
我每天只想着活到第二天
I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.

1795
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,990
我从未想过灭霸对你做了什么
And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.

1796
02:01:02,770 --> 02:01:04,110
我想弥补
I'm trying to make it right.

1797
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:07,370
整个宇宙中还有其他你这样的小女孩
There are little girls like you across the universe

1798
02:01:07,380 --> 02:01:08,910
她们有危险
who are in danger.

1799
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:13,130
你可以留下  跟我们一起帮助她们
You can stay with us and help them.

1800
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:16,170
我杀了灭霸就能帮助她们
I will help them by killing Thanos.

1801
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:17,960
我不知道那是否能做到
I don't know if that's possible.

1802
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:35,120
你永远是我妹妹
You will always be my sister.

1803
02:02:19,980 --> 02:02:20,800
彼得
Pete!

1804
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:26,160
船长在一家旧货店为你找到了这个
Captain found this for you in a junker shop.

1805
02:02:26,170 --> 02:02:28,390
说你有一天会回来的
Said you'd come back to the fold someday.

1806
02:02:31,010 --> 02:02:31,880
是什么
What is it?

1807
02:02:32,190 --> 02:02:32,970
叫Zune
It's called a Zune.

1808
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:35,480
地球人现在都听这玩意了
It's what everybody's listening to on Earth nowadays.

1809
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:36,850
里面能存300首歌
It's got 300 songs on it.

1810
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:39,080
300首歌
300 songs?

1811
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:45,170
等等
Wait.

1812
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:53,490
火箭把残片捡走  重拼了起来
Rocket grabbed the pieces, and reassembled them.

1813
02:02:53,490 --> 02:02:55,630
我觉得勇度会希望留给你的
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

1814
02:02:59,450 --> 02:03:00,400
谢谢
Thanks...

1815
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:03,560
船长
Captain.

1816
02:04:16,050 --> 02:04:17,220
他们来了
They came.

1817
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:26,430
是什么
What is it?

1818
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:30,130
我给勇度以前的掠夺者朋友去了消息
I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies,

1819
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:31,680
把他做的事告诉了他们
and told them what he did.

1820
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:36,810
这是掠夺者的葬礼
It's a Ravager funeral.

1821
02:04:54,460 --> 02:04:56,080
好啊
Yeah!

1822
02:04:56,090 --> 02:04:57,410
好
Yeah!

1823
02:05:04,870 --> 02:05:06,900
他终究没有辜负我们  船长
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.

1824
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:09,260
是啊  孩子
No, he did not, son.

1825
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:12,070
他没有
He did not.

1826
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:22,240
永别了  老朋友
Fare thee well, old friend.

1827
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:28,680
勇度·尤冬塔  我们在群星中再会
Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.

1828
02:05:33,090 --> 02:05:34,740
他没把他们赶走
He didn't chase them away.

1829
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:36,110
是啊
No.

1830
02:05:37,370 --> 02:05:39,080
虽然他吼他们
Even though he yelled at them.

1831
02:05:40,150 --> 02:05:41,650
总那么尖酸
And was always mean.

1832
02:05:43,980 --> 02:05:46,140
还偷了他用不着的电池
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

1833
02:05:51,460 --> 02:05:52,830
当然不会了
Well, of course not.

1834
02:06:17,450 --> 02:06:18,220
怎么了
What?

1835
02:06:19,350 --> 02:06:20,450
就是
It's just...

1836
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:25,030
心照不宣的情愫
some unspoken thing.

1837
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:36,490
真美
It's beautiful.

1838
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:39,350
是啊
It is.

1839
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:42,320
你也很美
And so are you.

1840
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:46,410
内在美
On the inside.

1841
02:08:41,780 --> 02:08:43,280
真是遗憾
You know, it's a shame...

1842
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:46,150
要失去勇度这样的惨剧
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu

1843
02:08:46,150 --> 02:08:47,980
才让我们重聚
to bring us all together again.

1844
02:08:48,330 --> 02:08:50,180
但我觉得如果他知道我们重新组队
But I think he'd be proud knowing that

1845
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:52,030
一定会骄傲的
we are back as a team.

1846
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:53,300
我加入
I'm in.

1847
02:08:53,390 --> 02:08:54,170
太好了
Dope.

1848
02:08:54,180 --> 02:08:56,550
我想死你们了
I miss you guys so much!

1849
02:08:56,550 --> 02:08:58,020
太好了
Hell, yes.

1850
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:02,750
我们去偷点东西吧
What say we steal some shit?

1851
02:11:22,090 --> 02:11:24,650
大祭司  理事会在等您
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

1852
02:11:25,330 --> 02:11:28,190
他们不满我浪费了资源
They are perturbed I've wasted our resources.

1853
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:34,760
等他们看到了我的创造
When they see what I have created here

1854
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:36,940
他们的愤怒就会消散
their wrath will dissipate.

1855
02:11:39,450 --> 02:11:42,430
是新型生育荚吗  夫人
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?

1856
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:44,790
好孩子  那个
That, my child

1857
02:11:45,220 --> 02:11:47,140
是我们进化的下一步
is the next step in our evolution.

1858
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:49,810
更强大  更美丽
More powerful, more beautiful,

1859
02:11:50,570 --> 02:11:54,360
更有能力摧毁银河护卫队
more capable of destroying the Guardians of the Galaxy.

1860
02:11:57,340 --> 02:11:59,050
我就叫他
I think I shall call him...

1861
02:12:01,590 --> 02:12:02,520
亚当吧
Adam.

1862
02:14:05,850 --> 02:14:06,730
哥们
Dude.

1863
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:08,490
不是吧
Seriously?

1864
02:14:08,490 --> 02:14:11,160
你得清理你的房间  简直乱成一团
You gotta clean up your room. It's a complete mess.

1865
02:14:11,170 --> 02:14:12,630
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1866
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:14,800
我才不无聊  你才无聊
I am not boring. You're boring.

1867
02:14:14,800 --> 02:14:15,760
你知道什么无聊吗
You know what's boring?

1868
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:19,190
坐在那里  玩那个没劲的游戏
Sitting there, playing that mind-numbing game.

1869
02:14:19,190 --> 02:14:22,910
无聊的是我每天要被你的藤蔓绊倒
What's boring is me tripping over your vines every day!

1870
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:24,620
我才不无聊
I'm not boring!

1871
02:14:24,690 --> 02:14:26,740
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1872
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,200
现在我能体会勇度当年的心情了
And now I know how Yondu felt.

1873
02:15:05,510 --> 02:15:07,640
在这艰难时期
In these times of hardship...

1874
02:15:09,100 --> 02:15:10,480
记住
just remember...

1875
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:15,820
我们是格鲁特
We. Are. Groot.

1876
02:15:19,050 --> 02:15:20,190
伙计们
Hey, fellas.

1877
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:21,870
等等  你们去哪
Wait, where are you going?

1878
02:15:22,150 --> 02:15:24,570
你们不是要送我回家的吗
You were supposed to be my lift home.

1879
02:15:24,840 --> 02:15:26,530
我要怎么离开啊
How will I get out of here?

1880
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:27,950
天呐
Aw, gee...

1881
02:15:27,950 --> 02:15:30,820
我还有好多故事要讲呢
I've got so many more stories to tell.

1882
02:15:30,820 --> 02:15:32,210
伙计们
Aw, guys.

1883
02:15:32,260 --> 02:15:33,710
天呐
Oh, gee...
